Tis not loves going hurts my days but that it went in little ways

After all my erstwhile dear my no longer cherished need we say it was no love just because it perished

Alas how light a cause may move dissention between hearts that love

Every theory of love from Plato down teaches that each individual loves in the other sex what he lacks in himself

If we all discovered that we had only five minutes left to say all that we wanted to say every telephone booth would be occupied by people calling other people to tell them that they loved them

Immature love says I love you because I need you Mature love says I need you because I love you

Love doesnt grow on the trees like apples in Eden its something you have to make and you must use your imagination to make it too just like anything else Its all work work

Love is a kind of military service

Love is natures second son

Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds

Love is the delusion that one woman differs from another

Love is the irresistible desire to be desired irresistibly

Love makes the time pass Time makes love pass

Love rules without rules Amore regge senza legge

Love the itch and a cough cannot be hid

What we call love is the desire to awaken and to keep awake in anothers body heart and mind the responsibility of flattering in our place the self of which we are not very certain

When one loves somebody everything is clear where to go what to do it all takes care of itself and one doesnt have to ask anybody about anything

Where love rules there is no will to power and where power predominates love is lacking The one is the shadow of the other

Where there is love there is pain

Love consists in this that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other

No one has ever loved anyone the way everyone wants to be loved

We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love first to their advantage then to their disadvantage

Human love is often but the encounter of two weaknesses

I am two fools I know for loving and saying so

The supreme happiness of life is the conviction that we are loved

What dire offence from amrous causes springs What mighty contests rise from trivial things

From success you get a lot of things but not that great inside thing that love brings you

He who loves the more is the inferior and must suffer

Love you know seeks to make happy rather than to be happy

Love is a spendthrift leaves its arithmetic at home is always in the red

The loving are the daring

The porcupine whom one must handle gloved may be respected but is never loved

Little privations are easily endured when the heart is better treated than the body

No love no friendship can cross the path of our destiny without leaving some mark on it forever

There is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear

I no longer cared about survival I merely loved

You can always get someone to love you even if you have to do it yourself

Youve got to love whats lovable and hate whats hateable It takes brains to see the difference

Romance without finance is no good

To live is like to love all reason is against it and all healthy instinct for it

People who throw kisses are hopelessly lazy

Wine comes in at the mouth and love comes in at the eye thats all we shall know for truth before we grow old and die

Love lives on propinquity but dies on contact

The heart that has truly loved never forgets but as truly loves on to the close

When the satisfaction or the security of another person becomes as significant to one as ones own satisfaction or security then the state of love exists

At the end of what is called the sexual life the only love which has lasted is the love which has everything every disappointment every failure and every betrayal which has accepted even the sad fact that in the end there is no desire so deep as the simple desire for companionship

When love and skill work together expect a masterpiece

The greater love is a mothers then comes a dogs then a sweethearts

Selfishness is one of the qualities apt to inspire love

There can be no peace of mind in love since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh startingpoint for further desires

Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking together in the same direction

The magic of first love is our ignorance that it can ever end

What we can do for another is the test of powers what we can suffer is the test of love

They gave each other a smile with a future in it

Many a man in love with a dimple makes the mistake of marrying the whole girl

There is one who kisses and the other who offers a cheek

The irony of love is that it guarantees some degree of anger fear and criticism

It has been wisely said that we cannot really love anybody at whom we never laugh

The entire sum of existence is the magic of being needed by just one person

A lady of fortyseven who has been married twentyseven years and has six children knows what love really is and once described it for me like this Love is what youve been through with somebody

And if I loved you Wednesday well what is that to you I do not love you Thursday so much is true

Happiness comes more from loving than being loved and often when our affection seems wounded it is only our vanity bleeding To love and to be hurt often and to love again this is the brave and happy life

If you cannot inspire a woman with love of you fill her above the brim with love of herself all that runs over will be yours

No one can do me any good by loving me I have more love than I need or could do any good with but people do me good by making me love them which isnt easy

Love is a gross exaggeration of the difference between one person and everybody else

Respect is love in plain clothes

A man is only as good as what he loves

In the act of loving someone you arm them against you

If you want to be loved be lovable

The one thing we can never get enough of is love And the one thing we never give enough of is love

Love makes of the wisest man a fool and of the most foolish woman a sage

In how many lives does Love really play a dominant part The average taxpayer is no more capable of a grand passion than of a grand opera

Love all love of other sights controls And makes one little room an everywhere

If we are to judge of love by its consequences it more nearly resembles hatred than friendship

Love cannot accept what it is Everywhere on earth it cries out against kindness compassion intelligence everything that leads to compromise Love demands the impossible the absolute the sky on fire inexhaustible springtime life after death and death itself transfigured into eternal life

unloves the heavenless hell and homeless home lovers alone wear sunlight

The sweetest joy the wildest woe is love

Man loves little and often woman much and rarely

Love in France is a comedy in England a tragedy in Italy an opera seria and in Germany a melodrama

Our first and last love is selflove

The first sigh of love is the last of wisdom

Oh my luves like a red red rose Thats newly sprung in June Oh my luves like the melodie Thats sweetly played in tune

Mans love is of mans life a thing apart Tis womans whole existence

Of all the girls that are so smart Theres none like pretty Sally She is the darling of my heart And lives in our alley

Theres no love lost between us

All thoughts all passions all delights Whatever stirs this mortal frame All are but ministers of Love And feed his sacred flame

Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned

How wise are they that are but fools in love

Love with men is not a sentiment but an idea

Love is an ocean of emotions entirely surrounded by expenses

We are all born for love It is the principle of existence and its only end

If yet I have not all thy love love Dear I shall never have it all

But one always returns to ones first loves

If you would be loved love and be lovable

Its love its love that makes the world go round

All mankind love a lover

Young men wish love money and health One day theyll say health money and love

Man begins by loving love and ends by loving a woman Woman begins by loving a man and ends by loving love

Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth

You say to mewards your affections strong Pray love me little so you love me long

Love is a conflict between reflexes and reflections

Pale hands I loved beside the Shalimar Where are you now Who lies beneath your spell Whom do you lead on Raptures roadway far Before you agonize them in farewell

There is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear

Loves like the measles all the worse when it comes late in life

Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends

Love in a hut with water and a crust Is Love forgive us cinders ashes dust

Sing for faith and hope are high None so true as you and I Sing the Lovers Litany Love like ours can never die

The reason why lovers and their mistresses never tire of being together is that they are always talking of themselves

I could not love thee dear so much Loved I not honour more

I love a lassie a bonnie bonnie lassie Shes as pure as the lily in the dell Shes as sweet as the heather The bonnie bloomin heather Mary ma Scotch Bluebell

Come live with me and be my love And we will all the pleasures prove That valleys groves or hills or fields Or woods and steepy mountains yield

He who for love hath undergone The worst that can befall Is happier thousandfold than one Who never loved at all

So dear I love him that with him all deaths I could endure without him live no life

Love is often a fruit of marriage

But theres nothing half so sweet in life As loves young dream

The only victory over love is flight

Love a grave mental disease

Everybody in love is blind

Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith

As one who cons at evening oer an album all alone And muses on the faces of the friends that he has known So I turn the leaves of Fancy till in shadowy design I find the smiling features of an old sweetheart of mine

Love must have wings to fly away from love And to fly back again

Love is the fulfilling of the law

The hours I spent with thee dear heart Are as a string of pearls to me I could them over every one apart My rosary my rosary

And love is loveliest when embalmd in tears

Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love

Ay me for aught that I ever could read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth

Give me my Romeo and when he shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun

Whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God

Love sought is good but given unsought is better

The fickleness of the woman I love is equalled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me

Love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave

Many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it

Blue eyes say Love me or I die black eyes say Love me or I kill thee

To love her was a liberal education

Some pray to marry the man they love My prayer will somewhat vary I humbly pray to Heaven above That I love the man I marry

Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all

Im sorry that I spelld the word I hate to go above you Because the brown eyes lower fell Because you see I love you

Werther had a love for Charlotte Such as words could never utter Would you know how first he met her She was cutting bread and butter

Love in its essence is spiritual fire

The best way to remember your wifes birthday is to forget it once

Shes too young for Medicare and too old for me to care

Gray hair is Gods graffiti

I lived in Miami for a while in a section with a lot of really old people The average age in my apartment house was dead

Good Americans when they die go to Paris

We had a very successful trip to Russia we got back

Enjoy life Think of all the women who passed up dessert on the Titanic

Everybody should believe in something I believe Ill have another drink

I know lots more old drunks than old doctors

Im a onedrink woman two at the most three Im under the table four Im under the host

My doctor said I look like a million dollars green and wrinkled

Condoms arent completely safe A friend of mine was wearing one and got hit by a bus

My doctor gave me six months to live but when I couldnt pay the bill he gave me six months more

I cant believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm you were the quickest

I hope you live to be as old as your jokes

My wife is the most wonderful woman in the world and thats not just my opinion its hers

she Before we got married you told me you were welloff he I was and I didnt know it

A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband

Why did God make man before he made woman Because he didnt want any advice on how to do it

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire

For every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing

The moment somebody says to me This is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me

Discontent is the first step in progress No one knows what is in him till he tries and many would never try if they were not forced to

All progress is based upon a universal innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income

It is the spur of ignorance the consciousness of not understanding and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress

One starts an action simply because one must do something

What you are must always displease you if you would attain to that which you are not

If youre good to your staff when things are going well theyll rally when times go bad

Praise out of season or tactlessly bestowed can freeze the heart as much as blame

The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real

Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force

And we find at the end of a perfect day The soul of a friend weve made

Love is like the wildrose briar Friendship is like the hollytree The holly is dark when the rose briar blooms But which will bloom most constantly

Life without a friend is death without a witness

Without friends no one would choose to live though he had all other goods

We call that person who has lost his father an orphan and a widower that man who has lost his wife But that man who has known that immense unhappiness of losing a friend by what name do we call him Here every language holds its peace in impotence

The great difference between voyages rests not in ships but in the people you meet on them

Only solitary men know the full joys of friendship Others have their family but to a solitary and an exile his friends are everything

It seems to me that trying to live without friends is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee It is a whole lot of trouble and then not worth much after you get it

Friendship is the bread of the heart

There is no hope or joy except in human relations

I feel the need of relations and friendship of affection of friendly intercourse I cannot miss these things without feeling as does any other intelligent man a void and a deep need

Your wealth is where your friends are

Today a man discovered gold and fame Another flew the stormy seas Another set an unarmed world aflame One found the germ of a disease But what high fates my path attend for ItodayI found a friend

Though Love be deeper Friendship is more wide

That is the bestto laugh with someone because you think the same things are funny

Can you understand how cruelly I feel the lack of friends who will believe in me a bit

To have a good friend is one of the highest delights of life to be a good friend is one of the noblest and most difficult undertakings

The two most important things in life are good friends and a strong bull pen

There is no wilderness like a life without friends friendship multiplies blessings and minimizes misfortunes it is a unique remedy against adversity and it soothes the soul

There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship

Mans best support is a very dear friend

A cheer then for the noblest breast That fears not dangers post And like the lifeboat proves a friend When friends are wanted most

I know what things are good friendship and work and conversation

Friendship is the source of the greatest pleasures and without friends even the most agreeable pursuits become tedious

No medicine is more valuable none more efficacious none better suited to the cure of all our temporal ills than a friend to whom we may turn for consolation in time of trouble and with whom we may share our happiness in time of joy

My only sketch profile of heaven is a large blue sky and larger than the biggest I have seen in Juneand in it are my friendsevery one of them

If I dont have friends then I aint nothing

Brotherhood is the very price and condition of mans survival

One thing everybody in the world wants and needs is friendliness

A man cannot be said to succeed in this life who does not satisfy one friend

We take care of our health we lay up money we make our roof tight and our clothing sufficient but who provides wisely that he shall not be wanting in the best property of allfriends

There is no physician like a true friend

There is nothing meritorious but virtue and friendship

The bird a nest the spider a web man friendship

True happiness arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions

It was such a joy to see thee I wish I could tell how much thee is to my life I always turn to thee as a sort of rest

Today a man discovered gold and fame Another flew the stormy seas Another set an unarmed world aflame One found the germ of a disease But what high fates my path attend For ItodayI found a friend

Good friends good books and a sleepy conscience this is the ideal life

Man is a knot a web a mesh into which relationships are tied Only those relationships matter

Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together

If each of us were to confess his most secret desire the one that inspires all his plans all his actions he would say I want to be praised

Some people change their ways when they see the light others when they feel the heat

No leader can be too far ahead of his followers

As long as I have a want I have a reason for living Satisfaction is death

Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great

We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough What do you want most to do Thats what I have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties

Love makes the wildest spirit tame and the tamest spirit wild

Great men undertake great things because they are great fools because they think them easy

We must each find our separate meaning in the persuasion of our days until we meet in the meaning of the world

Fear desire hope still push us on toward the future

It is for the superfluous things of life that men sweat

Urgent necessity prompts many to do things

Fear is the denomination of the Old Testament belief is the denomination of the New

The English of the Bible has a pithiness and raciness a homely tang a terse sententiousness an idiomatic flavour which comes home to mens business and bosoms a nobility of diction and a rhythmic quality unrivaled in its beauty

The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world

That kind of socalled housekeeping where they have six Bibles and no corkscrew

The total absence of humour in the Bible is one of the most singular things in all literature

The Old and New Testaments are the Great Code of Art

The fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge

I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith

I am fearfully and wonderfully made

The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint

It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house

Oh my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt

A prophet is not without honour save in his own country

Be not curious in unnecessary matters for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand

Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee neither search the things that are above thy strength

How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace

His countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow

Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you

Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap

Watchman what of the night

Man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets

The letter killeth but the spirit giveth life

For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle

Borne the burden and heat of the day

The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose

Entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me

We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept

I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot

They are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away

Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house

Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman

When caught reading the Bible WC Fields said Tm looking for loopholes The Bible is nothing but a succession of civil rights struggles by the Jewish people against their oppressors

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength

Unto everyone that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath

He that is not with me is against me

Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward

For what is your life It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away

My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle

I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart

The bible should be taught so early and so thoroughly that it sinks straight to the bottom of the mind where everything that comes along can settle on it

A decent boldness ever meets with friends

It is not enough to succeed a friend must fail

A friend in power is a friend lost

A friend is one before whom I may think aloud

Iron sharpeneth man so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend

Chance makes our parents but choice makes our friends

Hope is a pleasant acquaintance but an unsafe friend

Money cant buy friends but you can get a better class of enemy

Every time I paint a portrait I lose a friend

My heart is warm with the friends I make And better friends Ill not be knowing Yet there isnt a train I wouldnt take No matter where its going

A sympathetic friend can be quite dear as a brother

Friends are relatives you make for yourself

A good friend is my nearest relation

If you want an accounting of your worth count your friends

A true friend is the best possession

Best friend my wellspring in the wilderness

The only way to have a friend is to be one

A friend should be a master at guessing and keeping still

I have lost friends some by death others by sheer inability to cross the street

Faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful

An old friend never can be found and nature has provided that he cannot easily be lost

One whos our friend is fond of us one whos fond of us isnt necessarily our friend

True friends face in the same direction toward common projects interests goals

Friends are a second existence

My helpless friend your helplessness is the most powerful plea which rises up to the tender fatherheart of God You think that everything is closed to you because you cannot pray My friend your helplessness is the very essence of prayer

What makes old age so sad is not that our joys but our hopes cease

No sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than disbelief in great men

No one is more profoundly sad than he who laughs too much

Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion

A feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain

Reminiscences make one feel so deliciously aged and sad

Poverty makes you sad as well as wise

Sadness is a state of sin

Sadness and gladness succeed each other

Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves

It is sad to grow old but nice to ripen

Sadness flies on the wings of the morning and out of the heart of darkness comes the light

Sadness flies away on the wings of time

Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire

Sadness is almost never anything but a form of fatigue

Every calling is great when greatly pursued

A great man stands on God A small man stands on a great man

Clever men are impressed in their differences from their fellows Wise men are conscious of their resemblance to them

The world knows nothing of its greatest men

Greatness is a road leading towards the unknown

Great and good are seldom the same man

None think the great unhappy but the great

All great men come out of the middle classes

The great are great only because we are on our knees Let us rise

The great end of life is not knowledge but action

Everything great in the world comes from neurotics They alone have founded our religions and composed our masterpieces Never will the world know all it owes to them nor all they have suffered to enrich us

Im a great believer in luck I find the harder I work the more I have of it

The great cathedral space which was childhood

A great part of courage is the courage of having done the thing before

Life is a great surprise I do not see why death should not be an even greater one

Only great men may have great faults

Great and good are seldom the same man

None think the great unhappy but the great

Behind every great man there is a surprised woman

A great secret of success is to go through life as a man who never gets used up

Great men are not always wise

In great moments life seems neither right nor wrong but something greater it seems inevitable

All the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today

Every calling is great when greatly pursued

The world knows nothing of its greatest men

Greatness is a road leading towards the unknown

Great and good are seldom the same man

None think the great unhappy but the great

All great men come out of the middle classes

The great are great only because we are on our knees Let us rise

The great end of life is not knowledge but action

Everything great in the world comes from neurotics They alone have founded our religions and composed our masterpieces Never will the world know all it owes to them nor all they have suffered to enrich us

Im a great believer in luck I find the harder I work the more I have of it

A great part of courage is the courage of having done the thing before

Life is a great surprise I do not see why death should not be an even greater one

Only great men may have great faults

Great and good are seldom the same man

None think the great unhappy but the great

Behind every great man there is a surprised woman

Every calling is great when greatly pursued

All the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today

When we think we lead we most are led

An army of stags led by a lion would be better than an army of lions led by a stag

If the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch

Reason and judgment are the qualities of a leader

A mothers love for her child is like nothing else in the world It knows no aw no pity it dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path

Mother love has been much maligned An over mothered boy may go through life expecting each new woman to love him the way his mother did Her love may make any other love seem inadequate But an unloved boy would be even more likely to idealize love I dont think its possible for a mother or father to love a child too much

Unconditional love is loving your kids for who they are not for what they do it isnt something you will achieve every minute of every day But it is the thought we must hold in our hearts every day

The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother

Where does the family start It starts with a young man falling in love with a girl no superior alternative has yet been found

Of course if you like your kids if you love them from the moment they begin you yourself begin all over again in them and with them

You can see them alongside the shuffleboard courts in Florida or on the porches of the old folks homes up north They are in love they have always been in love although sometimes they would have denied it And because they have been in love they have survived everything that life could throw at them even their own failures

In family life love is the oil that eases friction the cement that binds closer together and the music that brings harmony

Family love is messy clinging and of an annoying and repetitive pattern like bad wallpaper

In truth a family is what you make it It is made strong not by number of heads counted at the dinner table but by the rituals you help family members create by the memories you share by the commitment of time caring and love you show to one another and by the hopes for the future you have as individuals and as a unit

A mother discovers with great delight that one does not love ones children just because they are ones children but because of the friendship formed while raising them

The Family is the Country of the heart There is an angel in the Family who by the mysterious influence of grace of sweetness and of love renders the fulfillment of duties less wearisome sorrows less bitter The only pure joys unmixed with sadness

Smile at each other smile at your wife smile at your husband smile at your children smile at each other it doesnt matter who it is and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other

No man has ever lived that had enough of childrens gratitude or womans love

I take my children everywhere but they always find their way back home

Happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city

The real question isnt whether or not you love your kids but how well you are able to demonstrate your love and caring so that your children really feel loved

The last step in parental love involves the release of the beloved the willing cutting of the cord that would otherwise keep the child in a state of emotional dependence

So if you have a grandma Thank the Good Lord up above And give Grandmama hugs and kisses For grandmothers are to love

Oh I love to see a man with a cigar It reminds me of my grandfather Morning to night he used to sit with a great big stogie dangling from his lips Oh the hours we kids used to spend sitting on his lap playing with the yellow whiskers beneath his nose Then hed take out his teeth with the cigar still in them and chase us around the room Wed all laugh and laugh then suddenly Grampas mood would change and wed all have to run for our lives You cant buy memories like that

Children begin by loving their parents After a time they judge them Rarely if ever do they forgive them

It is my pleasure that my children are free and happy and unrestrained by parental tyranny Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents

Perfect love sometimes does not come until the first grandchild

The reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy

The whole world is my family

To us family means putting your arms around each other and being there

The happiest moments of my life have been the few which I have passed at home in the bosom of my family

The family with an old person in it possesses a jewel

Babies are such a nice way to start people

Each time a new baby is born there is a possibility of reprieve Each child is a new being a potential prophet a new spiritual prince a new spark of light precipitated into the outer darkness

Bringing a child into the world is the greatest act of hope there is

Children are the worlds most valuable resource and its best hope for the future

Blessed be childhood which brings down something of heaven into the midst of our rough earthliness

Children are the bridge to heaven

We are given children to test us and make us more spiritual

One laugh of a child will make the holiest day more sacred still

Children are the true connoisseurs Whats precious to them has no price only value

There are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of a child There are seven million

Children like animals use all their senses to discover the world Then artists come along and discover it the same way all over again

The only artists for whom I would make way are children For me the paintings of children belong side by side with the works of the masters

Why a fouryearold child could understand this report Run out and find me a fouryearold child

Adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up cause theyre looking for ideas

What do we teach our children We should say to each of them Do you know what you are You are a marvel You are unique You may become a Shakespeare a Michelangelo a Beethoven You have the capacity for anything

By giving children lots of affection you can help fill them with love and acceptance of themselves Then thats what they will have to give away

Teaching kids to count is fine but teaching them what counts is best

It is infinitely more useful for a child to hear a story told by a person than by computer Because the greatest part of the learning experience lies not in the particular words of the story but in the involvement with the individual reading it

The parents exist to teach the child but also they must learn what the child has to teach them and the child has a very great deal to teach them

Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure Therefore the Great Spirit may show to them many things which older people miss

Children have a remarkable talent for not taking the adult world with the kind of respect we are so confident it ought to be given To the irritation of authority figures of all sorts children expend considerable energy in clowning around They refuse to appreciate the gravity of our monumental concerns while we forget that if we were to become more like children our concerns might not be so monumental

Youth I Stay close to the young and a little rubs off

Those who love the young best stay young longer

As long as I continue to hear normal people telling me I am too childish I know Im doing just fine

One of the most obvious facts about grownups to a child is that they have forgotten what it is like to be a child

All of us collect fortunes when we are children A fortune of colors of lights and darkness of movement of tensions Some of us have the fantastic chance to go back to his fortune when grown up

So like a forgotten fire a childhood can always flare up again within us

The great man is he that does not lose his childheart

What God is to the world parents are to their children

Honor your father and your mother

Honor your father and mother even as you honor God for all three were partners in your creation

When I was a boy of fourteen my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around But when I got to be twentyone I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years

Remember no matter how many candles you blow out this year theres one gal who will always think of you as young strong and handsome your mother

Theres no way to be a perfect mother and a million ways to be a good one

God could not be everywhere therefore he made mothers

Parents are often so busy with the physical rearing of children that they miss the glory of parenthood just as the grandeur of the trees is lost when raking leaves

The best inheritance a parent can give his children is a few minutes of his time each day

If I had known how wonderful it would be to have grandchildren Id have had them first

Few things are more delightful than grandchildren fighting over your lap

The greatest sweetener of human life is Friendship

A friend might well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature

Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy much the greatest is the possession of friendship

Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together

The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him

What a great blessing is a friend with a heart so trusty you may safely bury all your secrets in it

When a friend is in trouble dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do Think up something appropriate and do it

A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out

The most I can do for my friend is simply to be his friend

Friendship improves happiness and abates misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief

It is not what you give your friend but what you are willing to give him that determines the quality of your friendship

A friend is someone who knows all about you and loves you just the same

It is not the talking that counts between friends it is the never needing to say what counts

True friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable

Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies

To be a good friend remember that we are human magnets that like attracts like and that as we give we get

Treat your friends as you do your pictures and place them in their best light

Friendships are fragile things and require as much care in handling as any other fragile and precious thing

Every man should have a fairsized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends

Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends never lose a chance to make them

You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you

The only way to have a friend is to be one

Friends will not only live in harmony but in melody

It is great to have friends when one is young but indeed it is still more so when you are getting old When we are young friends are like everything else a matter of course In the old days we know what it means to have them

Old friends are best King James used to call for his old shoes they were the easiest for his feet

Man is only miserable so far as he thinks himself so

A mans as miserable as he thinks he is

The most unhappy of all men is he who believes himself to be so

The mind is its own place and in itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of heaven

All happiness is in the mind

Happiness is not a matter of events it depends upon the tides of the mind

The greater part of our happiness or misery depends on our dispositions and not our circumstances

I am happy and content because I think I am

A happy life consists in tranquility of mind

The happiest person is the person who thinks the most interesting thoughts

Unhappiness indicates wrong thinking just as ill health indicates a bad regimen

Happiness does not depend on outward things but on the way we see them

Happiness will never be any greater than the idea we have of it

He is happy that knoweth not himself to be otherwise

Misery is almost always the result of thinking

A great obstacle to happiness is to expect too much happiness

It isnt our position but our disposition that makes us happy

The best course was to buy a house across a road from a cemetery and look at it every morning Reminding yourself where it all ended anyway youd never get upset about anything again

Some patients I see are actually draining into their bodies the diseased thoughts of their minds

A sneer is like a flame it may occasionally be curative because it cauterizes but it leaves a bitter scar

Hate is like acid It can damage the vessel in which it is stored as well as destroy the object on which it is poured

The body manifests what the mind harbors

Since the human body tends to move in the direction of its expectationsplus or minusit is important to know that attitudes of confidence and determination are no less a part of the treatment program than medical science and technology

Tragedy had its compensations Once the worst misfortune occurred one never worried about the minor ones

Give me good health and Ill take care of the rest

When people asked I used to tell them how sick I was The more I talked about being sick the worse I got Finally I started saying Im getting better It took a while but then I started to feel better too

You can promote your healing by your thinking

Most of the time we think were sick its all in the mind

A critic is someone who never actually goes to the battle yet who afterwards comes out shooting the wounded

They never raised a statue to a critic

The weak are the most treacherous of us all They come to the strong and drain them They are bottomless They are insatiable They are always parched and always bitter They are everyones concern and like vampires they suck our lifes blood

No one can defeat us unless we first defeat ourselves

Play not with paradoxes That caustic which you handle in order to scorch others may happen to sear your own fingers and make them dead to the quality of things

Discussing how old you are is the temple of boredom

You cant be pessimistic because there are so many things that go wrong every day that if you were to be negative or pessimistic youd go out of business

We criticize and separate ourselves from the process Weve got to jump right in there with both feet

Wit is the salt of conversation not the food and few things in the world are more wearying than a sarcastic attitude towards life

You cant pay attention to your mistakes I made a mistake today I made a mistake yesterday I think its very important to ignore the negative

You just cant complain about being alive Its selfindulgent to be unhappy

We can destroy ourselves by cynicism and disillusion just as affectively as by bombs

One of the most devastating experiences in human life is disillusionment

The pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty

No pessimist ever discovered the secrets of the stars or sailed to an uncharted land or opened a new heaven to the human spirit

There are people who have an appetite for grief pleasure is not strong enough and they crave pain They have mithridatic stomachs which must be fed on poisoned bread natures so doomed that no prosperity can sooth their ragged and dishevelled desolation

I dont believe in pessimism

If any has a stone to throw It is not I ever or now

Cynicism is intellectual dandyism

When one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us

Do not sit long with a sad friend When you go to a garden do you look at the weeds Spend more time with the roses and jasmines

A vacant mind invites dangerous inmates as a deserted mansion tempts wandering outcasts to enter and take up their abode in its desolate apartments

Great things are not something accidental but must certainly be willed

Cease to be a drudge seek to be an artist

True revolutions restore more than they destroy

There are seeds of selfdestruction in all of us that will bear only unhappiness if allowed to grow

We have seen too much defeatism too much pessimism too much of a negative approach

This is the way of peaceovercome evil with good and falsehood with truth and hatred with love

The evil of the world is made possible by nothing but the sanction you give it

If you make fun of bad persons you make yourself beneath them Be kind to bad and good for you dont know your own heart

We have learned that power is a positive force if it is used for positive purposes

The optimism of a healthy mind is indefatigable

If I were to wish for anything I should not wish for wealth and power but for the passionate sense of the potential for the eye which ever young and ardent sees the possible what wine is so sparkling so fragrant so intoxicating as possibility

What after all has maintained the human race on this old globe despite all the calamities of nature and all the tragic failings of mankind if not the faith in new possibilities and the courage to advocate them

The basic success orientation is having an optimistic attitude

Think positively and masterfully with confidence and faith and life becomes more secure more fraught with action richer in achievement and experience

Am I like the optimist who while falling ten stories from a building says at each story Im all right so far

It doesnt hurt to be optimistic You can always cry later

The biggest quality in successful people I think is an impatience with negative thinking my feeling was even if its as bad as I think it is well make it work

I cannot discover that anyone knows enough to say definitely what is and what is not possible

I have learned to use the word impossible with the greatest caution

The Wright brothers flew right through the smoke screen of impossibility

On the human chessboard all moves are possible

In the long run the pessimist may be proved to be right but the optimist has a better time on the trip

All things are possible until they are proved impossibleand even the impossible may only be so as of now

One is not born a genius one becomes a genius

Like begets like honesty begets honesty trust trust and so on

Honor begets honor trust begets trust faith begets faith and hope is the mainspring of life

Events circumstances etc have their origin in ourselves They spring from seeds which we have sown

Hope is like a road in the country there was never a road but when many people walk on it the road comes into existence

If fear is cultivated it will become stronger if faith is cultivated it will achieve mastery

The process of maturing is an art to be learned an effort to be sustained By the age of fifty you have made yourself what you are and if it is good it is better than your youth

A human being fashions his consequences as surely as he fashions his goods or his dwelling Nothing that he says thinks or does is without consequences

We create our fate every day most of the ills we suffer from are directly traceable to our own behavior

It seems to me probably that any one who has a series of intolerable positions to put up with must have been responsible for them to some extent they have contributed to it by impatience or intolerance or brusquenessor some provocation

Opportunities multiply as they are seized they die when neglected Life is a long line of opportunities

I have found that if you love life life will love you back

A man is a method a progressive arrangement a selecting principle gathering his like unto him wherever he goes What you are comes to you

Thousands upon thousands are yearly brought into a state of real poverty by their great anxiety not to be thought poor

Choice is the essence of what I believe it is to be human

Kindness gives birth to kindness

We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them

I made the decision Im accountable

What we prepare for is what we shall get

We make our own criminals and their crimes are congruent with the national culture we all share It has been said that a people get the kind of political leadership they deserve I think they also get the kinds of crime and criminals they themselves bring into being

If one asks for success and prepares for failure he will get the situation he has prepared for

We are accountable only to ourselves for what happens to us in our lives

I attribute my success to this I never gave or took an excuse

The world has a way of giving what is demanded of it If you are frightened and look for failure and poverty you will get them no matter how hard you may try to succeed Lack of faith in yourself in what life will do for you cuts you off from the good things of the world Expect victory and you make victory Nowhere is this truer than in business life where bravery and faith bring both material and spiritual rewards

Fear to let fall a drop and you spill a lot

To be ambitious for wealth and yet always expecting to be poor to be always doubting your ability to get what you long for is like trying to reach east by travelling west There is no philosophy which will help a man to succeed when he is always doubting his ability to do so and thus attracting failure No matter how hard you work for success if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure it will kill your efforts neutralize your endeavors and make success impossible

I feel that one must deliberate then act must scan every life choice with rational thinking but then base the decision on whether ones heart will be in it

Since everything is in our heads we better not lose them

There is a passion for perfection which you rarely see fully developed but you may note this fact that in successful lives it is never wholly lacking

Many of the most successful men I have known have never grown up They have retained bubblingover boyishness They have relished wit they have indulged in humor They have not allowed dignity to depress them into moroseness Youthfulness of spirit is the twin brother of optimism and optimism is the stuff of which American business success is fashioned Resist growing up

People are subject to moods to temptations and fears lethargy and aberration and ignorance and the staunchest qualities shift under the stresses and strains of daily life

Whoever said Its not whether you win or lose that counts probably lost

If you have the will to win you have achieved half your success if you dont you have achieved half your failure

Someones always saying Its not whether you win or lose but if you feel that way youre as good as dead

The real difference between men is energy

Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm

To bring ones self to a frame of mind and to the proper energy to accomplish things that require plain hard work continuously is the one big battle that everyone has When this battle is won for all time then everything is easy

We would accomplish many more things if we did not think of them as impossible

Faith that the thing can be done is essential to any great achievement

Sometimes success is due less to ability than to zeal

We can accomplish almost anything within our ability if we but think that we can

Optimism is essential to achievement and it is also the foundation of courage and of true progress

Morale is the greatest single factor in successful wars

The will to conquer is the first condition of victory

Always bear in mind that your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing

The real secret of success is enthusiasm Yes more than enthusiasm I would say excitement I like to see men get excited When they get excited they make a success of their lives

It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it

The measure of an enthusiasm must be taken between interesting events It is between bites that the lukewarm angler loses heart

Enthusiasm for ones goal lessens the disagreeableness of working toward it

To burn always with this hard gemlike flame to maintain this ecstasy is success in life

Every man is enthusiastic at times One man has enthusiasm for thirty minutes another man has it for thirty days But it is the man who has it for thirty years who makes a success in life

Man never rises to great truths without enthusiasm

Success is due less to ability than to zeal

I rate enthusiasm even above professional skill

Do it big or stay in bed

Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm

What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm miracles can happen When we do our work with a dynamic conquering spirit we get things done

If youre not happy every morning when you get up leave for work or start to work at home if youre not enthusiastic about doing that youre not going to be successful

The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity and execute with vigor

A strong passion for any object will ensure success for the desire of the end will point out the means

If you want to succeed you must make your own opportunities as you go

A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds

No man will succeed unless he is ready to face and overcome difficulties and prepared to assume responsibilities

Man is still responsible His success lies not with the stars but with himself He must carry on the fight of selfcorrection and discipline

No one can help you in holding a good job except Old Man You

Under normal periods any mans success hinges about five percent on what others do for him and 95 percent on what he does

If after all men cannot always make history have a meaning they can always act so that their own lives have one

The brave man carves out his fortune and every man is the sum of his own works

If a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up

Pa he always said a man had to look spry for himself because nobody would do it for him your opportunities didnt come knocking around you had to hunt them down and hogtie them

Men at some time are masters of their fates

Destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved

The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they cant find them make them

Every man is the architect of his own fortune

The men who have done big things are those who were not afraid to attempt big things who were not afraid to risk failure in order to gain success

If the riskreward ratio is right you can make big money buying trouble

What isnt tried wont work

He that is overcautious will accomplish little

All great reforms require one to dare a lot to win a little

If you limit your actions in life to things that nobody can possibly find fault with you will not do much

The ambitious climbs high and perilous stairs and never cares how to come down the desire of rising hath swallowed up his fear of a fall

He that would have fruit must climb the tree

To get profit without risk experience without danger and reward without work is as impossible as it is to live without being born

Every noble acquisition is attended with its risks he who fears to encounter the one must not expect to obtain the other

The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity and execute with vigor

Great deeds are usually wrought at great risks

Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly

No one reaches a high position without daring

Cadillacs are down at the end of the bat

It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks

You cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine

Who dares nothing need hope for nothing

Progress always involves risks You cant steal second base and keep your foot on first

I dont think about risks much I just do what I want to do If you gotta go you gotta go

Behold the turtle He makes progress only when he sticks his neck out

Nothing ventured nothing gained

You cant catch trout with dry breeches

Dont be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated You cant cross a chasm in two small jumps

Because a fellow has failed once or twice or a dozen times you dont want to set him down as a failure till hes dead or loses his courageand thats the same thing

What is more mortifying than to feel that you have missed the plum for want of courage to shake the tree

To persevere trusting in what hopes he has is courage The coward despairs

Whatever you do you need courage To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires some of the same courage which a soldier needs

Who dares nothing need hope for nothing

Have the courage of your desire

To see what is right and not do it is want of courage

It takes vision and courage to create it takes faith and courage to prove

No great thing comes to any man unless he has courage

Great things are done more through courage than through wisdom

Courage permits the caliber of performance to continue at its peak until the finish line is crossed

Failure is only postponed success as long as courage coaches ambition The habit of persistence is the habit of victory

Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air

You will never do anything in this world without courage

It takes as much courage to have tried and failed as it does to have tried and succeeded

Where there is a brave man in the thickest of the fight there is the post of honor

Whenever you see a successful business someone once made a courageous decision

There are a lot of fellas with all the ability it takes to play in the major leagues but they never make it they always get stuck in the minor leagues because they havent got the guts to make the climb

Courage to start and willingness to keep everlasting at it are the requisites for success

One of the biggest factors in success is the courage to undertake something

It is weak and despicable to go on wanting things and not trying to get them

The measure of achievement is not winning awards Its doing something that you appreciate something you believe is worthwhile I think of my strawberry souffle I did that at least twentyeight times before I finally conquered it

Nothing worthwhile comes easily Half effort does not produce half results It produces no results Work continuous work and hard work is the only way to accomplish results that last

If a man wakes up famous he hasnt been sleeping

What it comes down to is that anybody can win with the best horse What makes you good is if you can take the second or third best horse and win

Success is dependent on effort

Success comes before work only in the dictionary

Success is having a flair for the thing that you are doing knowing that is not enough that you have got to have hard work and a sense of purpose

Striving for success without hard work is like trying to harvest where you havent planted

Sweat plus sacrifice equals success

Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it

Excellence in any pursuit is the late ripe fruit of toil

Its in the preparationin those dreary pedestrian virtues they taught you in seventh grade and you didnt believe Its making the extra call and caring a lot

In all human affairs there are efforts and there are results and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result

It is no use saying we are doing our best You have got to succeed in doing what is necessary

Social advance depends as much upon the process through which it is secured as upon the result itself

Until they are of the age to use the brain

Crime seems to change character when it crosses a bridge or a tunnel In the city crime is taken as emblematic of class and race In the suburbs though its intimate and psychologicalresistant to generalization a mystery of the individual soul

Since when do grown men and women who presume to hold high government office and exercise what they think of as moral leadership require ethics officers to tell them whether it is or isnt permissible to grab the secretarys behind or redirect public funds to their own personal advantage

Vice Is nice But a little virtue Wont hurt you

The lesser evil is also evil

The great majority of successful business men and women have been and are possessors of strong personalities of the right sort and by analyzing their climb to success it is amazing to discover how large a part good manners good breeding and correct behavior have had in helping them to win the goal

I dont eat junk food and I dont think junk thoughts

The Department of Justice is committed to asking one central question of everything we do What is the right thing to do Now that can produce debate and I want it to be spirited debate I want the lawyers of America to be able to call me and tell me Janet have you lost your mind

The voice of conscience is so delicate that it is easy to stifle it but it is also so clear that it is impossible to mistake it

Many people who wonder why they dont amount to more than they do have good stuff in them and are energetic persevering and have ample opportunities It is all a case of trimming the useless branches and throwing the whole force of power into the development of something that counts

Noble deeds and hot baths are the best cures for depression

Will you be satisfied with the fruit of your lifes work Will the efforts you are making now bring you satisfaction when the things of time are receding and eternity looms ahead

The act of acting morally is behaving as if everything we do matters

I place a high moral value on the way people behave I find it repellent to have a lot and to behave with anything other than courtesy in the old sense of the wordpoliteness of the heart a gentleness of the spirit

Success depends on your ability to make and keep friends

Some men succeed by what they know some by what they do and a few by what they are

Try not to become a man of success but rather a man of value

It is abundantly clear that success tends to negate humility

Success seems to be that which forms the distinction between confidence and conceit

The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain egotistic and selfcomplacent is erroneous on the contrary it makes them for the most part humble tolerant and kind Failure makes people cruel and bitter

Character cannot be developed in ease and quiet Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened vision cleared ambition inspired and success achieved

If a man be selfcontrolled truthful wise and resolute is there aught that can stay out of reach of such a man

Character is the real foundation of all worthwhile success

One of the first businesses of a sensible man is to know when he is beaten and to leave off fighting at once

If you cant accept losing you cant win

You cant have any successes unless you can accept failure

We have fought this fight as long and as well as we know how We have been defeated there is now but one course to pursue We must accept the situation

The most considerable difference I note among men is not in their readiness to fall into error but in their readiness to acknowledge these inevitable lapses

An error gracefully acknowledged is a victory won

The man who can own up to his error is greater than he who merely knows how to avoid making it

I have made mistakes but I have never made the mistake of claiming that I never made one

I am not the smartest or most talented person in the world but I succeeded because I keep going and going and going

Victory belongs to the most persevering

You can imprison a man but not an idea You can exile a man but not an idea You can kill a man but not an idea

It never pays to deal with the flyweights of the world They take far too much pleasure in thwarting you at every turn

I know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen

There is no point at which you can say Well Im successful now I might as well take a nap

I wrote for twelve years and collected 250 rejection slips before getting any fiction published so I guess outside reinforcement isnt all that important to me

I used to want the words She tried on my tombstone Now I want She did it

Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed

I am not afraid of the pen or the scaffold or the sword I will tell the truth whenever I please

Once I decide to do something I cant have people telling me I cant If theres a roadblock you jump over it walk around it crawl under it

Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go

Call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful business giants and you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits Edison went hungry many times before he became famous

Problems arise in that one has to find a balance between what people need from you and what you need for yourself

If your efforts are sometimes greeted with indifference dont lose heart The sun puts on a wonderful show at daybreak yet most of the people in the audience go on sleeping

If you wish success in life make perseverance your bosom friend

Perseverance is failing nineteen times and succeeding the twentieth

The only thing that happens overnight is recognition Not talent

If you rest you rust

If you dont quit and dont cheat and dont run home when trouble arrives you can only win

They who are the most persistent and work in the true spirit will invariably be the most successful

If at first you dont succeed try try try again

If at first you dont succeed youre running about average

The only way to the top is by persistent intelligent hard work

The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night

I realized early on that success was tied to not giving up Most people in this business gave up and went on to other things If you simply didnt give up you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you

Perseverance is a great element of success If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody

Four steps to achievement plan purposefully prepare prayerfully proceed positively pursue persistently

The secret of success is constancy of purpose

Im hardnosed about luck I think it sucks Yeah if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter and then one day somebody gives you a job you can say Gee I was lucky I happened to go up there today But dammit I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years If youre persistent in trying and doing and working you almost make your own fortune

Flaming enthusiasm backed up by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success

Its the plugging away that will win you the day So dont be a piker old pard Just draw on your grit its so easy to quit Its the keeping your chin up thats hard

No one succeeds without effort Those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance

Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting

Entrepreneurs average 38 failures before final success What sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence There are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going

Be of good cheer Do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow You have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles Remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost

The way to succeed is never quit Thats it But really be humble about it You start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there

Continuous effortnot strength or intelligenceis the key to unlocking our potential

Plodding wins the race

The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow

Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal My strength lies solely in my tenacity

A winner never quits and a quitter never wins

It isnt hard to be good from time to time in sports Whats tough is being good every day

If you start to take Vienna take Vienna

Theres such a thin line between winning and losing

Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose As a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck

In the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm in the real world all rests on perseverance

It takes time to be a success

Actually Im an overnight success But it took twenty years

It takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward for taking time to do anything well

Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed

It takes twenty years to make an overnight success

Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome

Our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselvesto break our own records to outstrip our yesterdays by our today to do our work with more force than ever before

Success has always been easy to measure It is the distance between ones origins and ones final achievement

How can they say my life is not a success Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten

Survival is triumph enough

Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming

Success is relative It is what we can make of the mess we have made of things

The conventional army loses if it does not win The guerrilla wins if he does not lose

The man who has done his level best and who is conscious that he has done his best is a success even though the world may write him down a failure

My success is measured by my willingness to keep trying

If youve had a good time playing the game youre a winner even if you lose

Success is living up to your potential Thats all Wake up with a smile and go after life Live it enjoy it taste it smell it feel it

I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith

On earth we have nothing to do with success or results but only with being true to God and for God Defeat in doing right is nevertheless victory

The reward of a thing well done is to have done it

Id rather be a lamppost in Chicago than a millionaire in any other city

A successful man is he who receives a great deal from his fellow men usually incomparably more than corresponds to his service to them The value of a man however should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive

There is only one successto be able to spend your life in your own way

We only do well the things we like doing

The only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be

Success based on anything but internal fulfillment is bound to be empty

All I would tell people is to hold on to what was individual about themselves not to allow their ambition for success to cause them to try to imitate the success of others Youve got to find it on your own terms

For me writing is the only thing that passes the three tests of metier 1 when Im doing it I dont feel that I should be doing something else instead 2 it produces a sense of accomplishment and once in a while pride and 3 its frightening

My mother said to me If you become a soldier youll be a general if you become a monk youll end up as the pope Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso

Abasement degradation is simply the manner of life of the man who has refused to be what it is his duty to be

Different people have different duties assigned to them by Nature Nature has given one the power or the desire to do this the other that Each bird must sing with his own throat

A first rate soup is better than a second rate painting

We cant all be heroes because someone has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by

Nature magically suits a man to his fortunes by making them the fruit of his character

Id rather be a lamppost in Chicago than a millionaire in any other city

We succeed in enterprises which demand the positive qualities we possess but we excel in those which can also make use of our defects

A man can do only what he can do But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day

Most ball games are lost not won

Never face facts if you do youll never get up in the morning

Before you can win a game you have to not lose it

Football games arent won theyre lost

Success is a journey not a destination

The journey is my home

To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive and the true success is to labor

The man who goes fishing gets something more than the fish he catches

Despite the success cult men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of effort involved in getting thereor failing to get there

To live only for some future goal is shallow Its the sides of the mountain that sustain life not the top

The reward of the general is not a bigger tent but command

It is good to have an end to journey toward but it is the journey that matters in the end

Were still not where were going but were not where we were

Tis the motive exalts the action Tis the doing and not the deed

Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another

I think that wherever your journey takes you there are new gods waiting there with divine patienceand laughter

It has never been and never will be easy work But the road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair even though they both lead to the same destination

In the long run the pessimist may be proved to be right but the optimist has a better time on the trip

The reward of a thing well done is to have done it

The struggle alone pleases us not the victory

The problem is not that you cannot have what you think you want The problem is that when you get what you think you want it wont satisfy

We should scarcely desire things ardently if we were perfectly acquainted with what we desire

With the catching ends the pleasures of the chase

To have realized your dream makes you feel lost

Need and struggle are what excite and inspire us our hour of triumph is what brings the void

We spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it

Happiness is not a station to arrive at but a manner of traveling

Happiness is to be found along the way not at the end of the road for then the journey is over and it is too late

The really happy man is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour

You wear yourself out in the pursuit of wealth or love or freedom you do everything to gain some right and once its gained you take no pleasure in it

Success is counted sweetest by those who neer succeed

Granting our wish is one of Fates saddest jokes

Now that Im here where am I

Success is not greedy as people think but insignificant Thats why it satisfies nobody

Is there anything in life so disenchanting as attainment

Nothing fails like success nothing is so defeated as yesterdays triumphant cause

There are two tragedies in life One is to lose your hearts desire The other is to gain it

Success has ruined many a man

Fame always brings loneliness Success is as ice cold and lonely as the North Pole

Success has killed more men than bullets

Achievement The death of an endeavor and the birth of disgust

Success and failure are equally disastrous

The problems of victory are more agreeable than those of defeat but they are no less difficult

We are never further from our wishes than when we imagine that we possess what we have desired

Some aspects of success seem rather silly as death approaches

Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom

If I had known what it would be like to have it all I might have been willing to settle for less

Success and failure are both difficult to endure Along with success come drugs divorce fornication bullying travel meditation medication depression neurosis and suicide With failure comes failure

The two hardest things to handle in life are failure and success

The best thing that can come with success is the knowledge that it is nothing to long for

The closer one gets to the top the more one finds there is no top

Oh how quickly the worlds glory passes away

The minute you think youve got it made disaster is just around the corner

Creating success is tough But keeping it is tougher You have to keep producing you cant ever stop

Out of every fruition of success no matter what comes forth something to make a new effort necessary

The toughest thing about success is that youve got to keep on being a success Talent is only a starting point in business Youve got to keep working that talent

We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified

Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won

Being frustrated is disagreeable but the real disasters of life begin when you get what you want

We grow weary of those things and perhaps soonest which we most desire

Our desires always increase with our possessions The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us

Oddly enough success over a period of time is more expensive than failure

There must be more to life than having everything

Its not that Im not grateful for all this attention Its just that fame and fortune ought to add up to more than fame and fortune

If you live long enough youll see that every victory turns into a defeat

One more such victory and we are undone

Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it

The prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors Who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream

Success can also cause misery The trick is not to be surprised when you discover it doesnt bring you all the happiness and answers you thought it would

Life is a succession of moments To live each one is to succeed

I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to his or her fellow human beings

Success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself Its what you do for others

If you have a good name if you are right more often than you are wrong if your children respect you if your grandchildren are glad to see you if your friends can count on you and you can count on them in time of trouble if you can face your God and say I have done my best then you are a success

Success produces success just as money produces money

If I do have some success Id like to enjoy it for heavens sake What is the point of having it otherwise

God may allow His servant to succeed when He has disciplined him to a point where he does not need to succeed to be happy The man who is elated by success and is cast down by failure is still a carnal man At best his fruit will have a worm in it

Nothing fails like success because we dont learn from it We learn only from failure

Success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism

Successful minds work like a gimlet to a single point

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence and then Success is sure

Success is counted sweetest By those who neer succeed

Nothing succeeds like success

There are but two ways of rising in the world either by ones own industry or profiting by the foolishness of others

I have always observed that to succeed in the world one should appear like a fool but be wise

Faith mighty faith the promise sees And looks to that alone Laughs at impossibilities And cries it shall be done

Either do not attempt at all or go through with it

To climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first

Somebodys said that it couldnt be done But he with a chuckle replied That maybe it couldnt but he would be one Who wouldnt say so till hed tried So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin On his face If he worried he hid it He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldnt be done and he did it

And he gave it for his opinion that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together

Call no man happy till he is dead

Though this may be play to you Tis death to us

Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection

In the midst of life we are in death

Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery He cometh up and is cut down like a flower he fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay

Death so called is a thing which makes men weep And yet a third of life is passd in sleep

Why fear death It is the most beautiful adventure in life

Now I am about to take my last voyage a great leap in the dark

Is death the last sleep No it is the last final awakening

The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord

We begin to die as soon as we are born and the end is linked to the beginning

There is no death the stars go down To rise upon some other shore And bright in Heavens jeweled crown They shine for ever more

Strange is it not that of the myriads who Before us passed the door of Darkness through Not one returns to tell us of the road Which to discover we must travel too

I am dying Egypt dying

Yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep

I have a rendezvous with Death At some disputed barricade

Till tired he sleeps and lifes poor play is oer

To die to sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished

Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it

Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field

First our pleasures die and then Our hopes and then our fears and when These are dead the debt is due Dust claims dust and we die too

Gods finger touched him and he slept

Sunset and evening star And one clear call for me And may there be no moaning of the bar When I put out to sea

Nothing can happen more beautiful than death

For he who lives more lives than one More deaths than one must die

I respect only those who resist me but cannot tolerate them

The easiest kind of relationship for me is with 10000 people The hardest is with one

The best contraceptive for old people is nudity

My health is good its my age thats bad

Hes so old his social security number is two digits

The best way to remember your wifes birthday is to forget it once

Shes too young for Medicare and too old for me to care

There are three signs of old age loss of memory I forget the other two

My wife loves Europe but to me its a bad day at a theme park

Hollywood is a place where people from Iowa mistake each other for movie stars

It is possible to live in San Francisco for 35000 a year Obviously that doesnt include food or lodging

Youre not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on

My sister says she never seems to get it together either her rear looks good or her face does

I wanted to marry her when I saw the moonlight shining on the barrel of her fathers shotgun

I was the best man at the wedding So why is she marrying him

Father giving advice to son Never do anything once around the house that you dont want to do for the rest of your life

Marriage is like a violin After the beautiful music is over the strings are still attached

My husband will never chase another woman Hes too fine too decent too old

Never get married in the morning because you never know who youll meet that night

When my wife was asked Do you take this man for richer or poorer she answered For richer

So you want to become my soninlaw Not exactly I just want to marry your daughter

I remember when I got married I remember where I got married But for the life of me I cant remember why I got married

American women expect to find in their husbands a perfection that English women only hope to find in their butlers

Behind every successful man youll find a woman who has nothing to wear

Men have a much better time of it than women For one thing they marry later For another thing they die earlier

A man is a person who will pay two dollars for a onedollar item he wants A woman will pay one dollar for a twodollar item she doesnt want

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire

For every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing

The moment somebody says to me This is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me

Discontent is the first step in progress No one knows what is in him till he tries and many would never try if they were not forced to

All progress is based upon a universal innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income

It is the spur of ignorance the consciousness of not understanding and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress

One starts an action simply because one must do something

What you are must always displease you if you would attain to that which you are not

If youre good to your staff when things are going well theyll rally when times go bad

Praise out of season or tactlessly bestowed can freeze the heart as much as blame

The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real

Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force

There is no such thing as inner peace there is only nervousness and death

When fire and water are at war it is the fire that loses

Before the war and especially before the Boer War it was summer all the year round

One sword keeps another in the sheath

Peace is a virtual mute sustained victory of potential powers against probable greeds

Peace is not an absence of war it is a virtue a state of mind a disposition for benevolence confidence justice

There are no makers of peace because the making of peace is at least as costly as the making of war at least as exigent

Once you hear the details of victory it is hard to distinguish it from a defeat

The peace of the man who has foresworn the use of the bullet seems to me not quite peace but a canting impotence

Where they make a desert they call it peace

That they may have a little peace even the best dogs are compelled to snarl occasionally

Peace in international affairs a period of cheating between two periods of fighting

They sicken of the calm who know the storm

Time spent with cats is never wasted

There are two means of refuge from the miseries of life music and cats

You cant look at a sleeping cat and be tense

It is impossible to keep a straight face in the presence of one or more kittens

Dogs come when theyre called cats take a message and get back to you

Cats are smarter than dogs You cant get eight cats to pull a sled through snow

Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want

Cats are angels with fur

Whoever said you cant buy happiness forgot about little puppies

There is no psychiatrist in the world like a puppy licking your face

Know thyself Dont accept your dogs admiration as conclusive evidence that you are wonderful

Dogs are not our whole life but they make our lives whole

Living with a dog is one way to retain something of a childs spirit

A dog Is the only thing on earth that loves you more than he loves himself

The greatest pleasure of a dog is that you may make a fool of yourself with him and not only will he not scold you but he will make a fool of himself too

The dog is the god of frolic

I wonder if other dogs think poodles are members of a weird religious cult

I have always thought of a dog lover as a dog that was in love with another dog

A dog wags its tail with its heart

Dogs laugh but they laugh with their tails

Money will buy a pretty good dog but it wont buy the wag of his tail

No matter how little money and how few possessions you own having a dog makes you rich

Peace is the first thing the angels sang Peace is the mark of the sons of God Peace is the nurse of love Peace is the mother of unity Peace is the rest of blessed souls Peace is the dwelling place of eternity

Peace is a daily a weekly a monthly process gradually changing opinions slowly eroding old barriers quietly building new structures And however undramatic the pursuit of peace the pursuit must go on

Choose to experience peace rather than conflict

You dont have to have fought in a war to love peace

War is an invention of the human mind The human mind can invent peace

I think that people want peace so much that one of these days governments had better get out of their way and let them have it

If we have no peace it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other

Until he extends his circle of compassion to all living things man will not find peace

It isnt enough to talk about peace one must believe in it And it isnt enough to believe in it one must work at it

Before its too late and time is running out let us turn from trust in the chain reactions of exploding atoms to faith of the chain reaction of Gods love Love love of God and fellow men That is Gods formula for peace

The more we sweat in peace the less we bleed in war

It is understanding that gives us an ability to have peace When we understand the other fellows viewpoint and he understands ours then we can sit down and work out our differences

It takes two to make peace

We merely want to live in peace with all the world to trade with them to commune with them to learn from their culture as they may learn from ours so that the products of our toil may be used for our schools and our roads and our churches and not for guns and planes and tanks and ships of war

The place to improve the world is first in ones own heart and head and hands

If we have not peace within ourselves it is in vain to seek it from outward sources

The only way to bring peace to the earth is to learn to make our own life peaceful

Peace like charity begins at home

May you have warmth in your igloo oil in your lamp and peace in your heart

Positive thoughts joy happiness fulfillment achievement worthiness have positive results enthusiasm calm wellbeing ease energy love Negative thoughts judgment unworthiness mistrust resentment fear produce negative results tension anxiety alienation anger fatigue

Could we change our attitude we should not only see life differently but life itself would come to be different Life would undergo a change of appearance because we ourselves had undergone a change in attitude

Life is a mirror and will reflect back to the thinker what he thinks into it

Our thoughts and imaginations are the only real limits to our possibilities

It is the mind that maketh good of ill that maketh wretch or happy rich or poor

Most of us can as we choose make of this world either a palace or a prison

We are each gifted in a unique and important way It is our privilege and our adventure to discover our own special light

Before a painter puts a brush to his canvas he sees his picture mentally If you think of yourself in terms of a painting what do you see Is the picture one you think worth painting You create yourself in the image you hold in your mind

We cannot tell what may happen to us in the strange medley of life But we can decide what happens in us how we take it what we do with it and that is what really counts in the end

Get into the habit of looking for the silver lining of the cloud and when you have found it continue to look at it rather than at the leaden gray in the middle It will help you over many hard places

Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow

There is very little difference in people but that little difference makes a big difference The little difference is attitude The big difference is whether it is positive or negative

It is not the situation It is your reaction to the situation

There are two big forces at work external and internal We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes earthquakes floods disasters illness and pain What really matters is the internal force How do I respond to those disasters Over that I have complete control

If you will call your troubles experiences and remember that every experience develops some latent force within you you will grow vigorous and happy however adverse your circumstances may seem to be

Diseases can be our spiritual flat tires disruptions in our lives that seem to be disasters at the time but end by redirecting our lives in a meaningful way

Out of difficulties grow miracles

Great emergencies and crises show us how much greater our vital resources are than we had supposed

In the depth of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer

God gave us our memories so that we might have roses in December

Im not afraid of storms for Im learning how to sail my ship

Help us to be the always hopeful gardeners of the spirit who know that without darkness nothing comes to birth as without light nothing flowers

The quickest way to change your attitude toward pain is to accept the fact that everything that happens to us has been designed for our spiritual growth

When somebody is angry with us we draw a halo around his or her head in our minds Does the person stop being angry then Well we dont know We know though that when we draw a halo around a person suddenly the person starts to look like an angel to us

Picture yourself placing your problem inside a pale yellow balloon letting it go watching it drift until it is a tiny pastel dot in the sky

Whenever something good happens write it down Buy a special notebook and use it to list all the good in your life

It doesnt hurt to be optimistic You can always cry later

The average pencil is seven inches long with just a halfinch eraser in case you thought optimism was dead

Pessimism never won any battle

Stop the mindless wishing that things would be different Rather than wasting time and emotional and spiritual energy in explaining why we dont have what we want we can start to pursue other ways to get it

Man is so made that whenever anything fires his soul impossibilities vanish

Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers powers that would astonish him that he never dreamed of possessing forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action

Within you right now is the power to do things you never dreamed possible This power becomes available to you just as soon as you can change your beliefs

Exhilaration of life can be found only with an upward look This is an exciting world It is crampacked with opportunity Great moments wait around every corner

Enthusiasm is the greatest asset in the world It beats money and power and influence

Nothing splendid has ever been achieved except by those who dared to believe that something inside of them was superior to circumstance

It is the ultimate wisdom of the mountains that we are never so much human as when we are striving for what is beyond our grasp and that there is no battle worth the winning save that against our own ignorance and fear

I keep the telephone of my mind open to peace harmony health love and abundance Then whenever doubt anxiety or fear try to call me they keep getting a busy signal and soon theyll forget my number

You can do anything you wish to do have anything you wish to have be anything you wish to be

People become really quite remarkable when they start thinking that they can do things When they believe in themselves they have the first secret of success

What lies behind us and what lies before us are small matter compared to what lies within us

No matter what level of your ability you have more potential than you can ever develop in a lifetime

Everyone has got it in him if he will only make up his mind and stick at it None of us is born with a stopvalve on his powers or with a set limit to his capacities There is no limit possible to the expansion of each one of us

Everyone has inside of him a piece of good news The good news is that you dont know how great you can bel How much you can love What you can accomplish And what your potential is I

The power which resides in man is new in nature and none but he knows what that is which he can do nor does he until he has tried

Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you For every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened

Trust yourself You know more than you think you do

If we did all the things we are capable of doing we would literally astound ourselves

Each of us makes his own weather determines the color of the skies in the emotional universe which he inhabits

Every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man Every thing we see today made by past generations was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman

Be brave enough to live creatively The creative is the place where no one else has ever been You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition You cannot get there by bus only by hard work risking and by not quite knowing what you are doing What you will discover will be wonderful yourself

Be not afraid of life Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact

Your living is determined not so much by what life brings to you as by the attitude you bring to life

I am not discouraged because every wrong attempt discarded is another step forward

What is defeat Nothing but education nothing but the first step toward something better

To every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage

Look at everything as though you were seeing it either for the first or last time Then your time on earth will be filled with glory

One for whom the pebble has value must be surrounded by treasures wherever he goes

Were all only fragile threads but what a tapestry we make

Today lets give thanks for life For life itself For simply being born

I prefer the most unfair peace to the most righteous war

Peace rules the day where reason rules the mind

Even peace may be purchased at too high a price

Peace be with you

I have never advocated war except as a means of peace

They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more

The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid

I am a man of peace God knows how I love peace but I hope I shall never be such a coward as to mistake oppression for peace

Peace at any price

Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men

Peace be to this house

Peace hath her victories No less renowned than war

If they want peace nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede cannonshots

Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace

Mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other

Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within they palaces

If peace cannot be maintained with honor it is no longer peace

Peace won by compromise is usually a shortlived achievement

If the pursuit of peace is both old and new it is also both complicated and simple It is complicated for it has to do with people and nothing in this universe baffles man as much as man himself

The wardrum throbbd no longer and the battleflags were furld In the parliament of man the federation of the world

To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace

A love of fashion makes the economy go round

A pious man is one who would be an atheist if the king were

Every generation laughs at the old fashions but religiously follows the new

Nothing is so hideous as an obsolete fashion

The tradition of the new Yesterdays avantgardexperiment is todays chic and tomorrows cliche

Art produces ugly things which frequently become beautiful with time Fashion on the other hand produces beautiful things which always become ugly with time

Be not the first by whom the new are tried Nor yet the last to lay the old aside

Fashion can be bought Style one must possess

Fashion which elevates the bad to the level of the good subsequently turns its back on bad and good alike

Even knowledge has to be in fashion and where it is not it is wise to affect ignorance

The fashion wears out more apparel than the man

Fashions after all are only induced epidemics

When a man is once in fashion all he does is right

I have heard with admiring submission the experience of the lady who declared that the sense of being welldressed gives a feeling of inward tranquility which religion is powerless to bestow

Fashion condemns us to many follies the greatest is to make oneself its slave

Conformism is so hot on the heels of the massproduced avantgarde that the ins and the outs change places with the speed of mach 3

There goes a man made by the Lord Almighty and not by his tailor

Fashions fade style is eternal

And by my grave youd pray to have me back So I could see how well you look in black

A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress

A fashionable woman is always in love with herself

I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man

Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months

Wealth lostsomething lost Honor lostmuch lost Courage lostall lost

Why not go out on a limb Isnt that where the fruit is

He who finds Fortune on his side should go briskly ahead for she is wont to favor the bold

Thats what being young is all about You have the courage and the daring to think that you can make a difference

A decent boldness ever meets with friends

In times of stress be bold and valiant

The brave venture anything

It is the bold man who every time does best at home or abroad

Attacking is the only secret Dare and the world always yields or if it beats you sometimes dare it again and it will succumb

Be content to stand in the light and let the shadow fall where it will

Never forget that life can only be nobly inspired and rightly lived if you take it bravely and gallantly as a splendid adventure in which you are setting out into an unknown country to meet many a joy to find many a comrade to win and lose many a battle

Life is the acceptance of responsibilities or their evasion it is a business of meeting obligations or avoiding them

The superior man makes the difficulty to be overcome his first interest success comes only later

There were always in me two women at least one woman desperate and bewildered who felt she was drowning and another who would leap into a scene as upon a stage conceal her true emotions because they were weaknesses helplessness despair and present to the world only a smile an eagerness curiosity enthusiasm interest

Facing italways facing itthats the way to get through Face it

If one is willing to do a thing he is afraid to do he does not have to face a situation fearlessly and if there is no situation to face it falls away of its own weight

He shall fare well who confronts circumstances aright

The best way out of a problem is through it

We cannot solve lifes problems except by solving them

The truth will set you free but first it will make you miserable

Have the courage to face a difficulty lest it kick you harder than you bargain for

A great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism and spends his energies upon that

It is often wonderful how putting down on paper a clear statement of a case helps one to see not perhaps the way out but the way in

As a rule what is out of sight disturbs mens minds more seriously than what they see

Every difficulty slurred over will be a ghost to disturb your repose later on

Fools through false shame conceal their open wounds

An oak and a reed were arguing about their strength When a strong wind came up the reed avoided being uprooted by bending and leaning with the gusts of wind But the oak stood firm and was torn up by the roots

The grass must bend when the wind blows across it

He who attempts to resist the wave is swept away but he who bends before it abides

Adapt or perish now as ever is natures inexorable imperative

One does not have to stand again the gale One yields and becomes part of the wind

I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do

Nature magically suits a man to his fortunes by making them the fruit of his character

Better bend than break

The secret of success is to be in harmony with existence to be always calm to let each wave of life wash us a little farther up the shore

There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will

The truth does not change according to our ability to stomach it emotionally

Happiness can exist only in acceptance

Happiness comes from within a man from some curious adjustment to life

Happy he who learns to bear what he cannot change

Contentment and indeed usefulness comes as the infallible result of great acceptances great humilitiesof not trying to conform to some dramatized version of ourselves

My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither but just enjoy your ice cream while its on your plate

It is not necessarily those lands which are the most fertile or most favored in climate that seem to me the happiest but those in which a long struggle of adaptation between man and his environment has brought out the best qualities of both

Life is not always what one wants it to be but to make the best of it as it is is the only way of being happy

Everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and I learn whatever state I may be in therein to be content

I accept life unconditionally Most people ask for happiness on condition Happiness can only be felt if you dont set any condition

Happiness is a function of accepting what is

Ones first step in wisdom is to question everything ones last is to come to terms with everything

If you are wise live as you can if you cannot live as you would

Wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it cant bring down

For this is wisdom to live to take what fate or the Gods may give

Acceptance and Work If you have a job without aggravations you dont have a job

When I decided to go into politics I weighed the costs I would get criticism But I went ahead So when virulent criticism came I wasnt surprised I was better able to handle it

Every job has drudgery The first secret of happiness is the recognition of this fundamental fact

The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore

He who doesnt accept the conditions of life sells his soul

Greatness of soul consists not so much in soaring high and in pressing forward as in knowing how to adapt and limit oneself

The beauty of the soul shines out when a man bears with composure one heavy mischance after another not because he does not feel them but because he is a man of high and heroic temper

The great soul surrenders itself to fate

The mind which renounces once and forever a futile hope has its compensations in evergrowing calm

I not only bow to the inevitable I am fortified by it

I have accepted all and I am free The inner chains are broken as well as those outside

The most beautiful thing is inevitability of events and the most ugly thing is trying to resist inevitability

Peace of mind is that mental condition in which you have accepted the worst

If we can recognize that change and uncertainty are basic principles we can greet the future and the transformation we are undergoing with the understanding that we do not know enough to be pessimistic

We cannot change anything unless we accept it

Acceptance of what has happened is the first step to overcoming the consequence of any misfortune

Almost any event will put on a new face when received with cheerful acceptance

What it is forbidden to be put right becomes lighter by acceptance

One completely overcomes only what one assimilates

If you cast away one cross you will certainly find another and perhaps a heavier

To repel ones cross is to make it heavier

Science says We must live and seeks the means of prolonging increasing facilitating and amplifying life of making it tolerable and acceptable wisdom says We must die and seeks how to make us die well

True freedom lies in the realization and calm acceptance of the fact that there may very well be no perfect answer

As the soft yield of water cleaves obstinate stone So to yield with life solves the insolvable To yield I have learned is to come back again

Things turn out best for people who make the best of the way things turn out

And acceptance is the answer to all my problems today I can find no serenity until I accept that person place thing or situation as being exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment

Resistance causes pain and lethargy It is when we practice acceptance that new possibilities appear

To oppose something is to maintain it

No life is so hard that you cant make it easier by the way you take it

Anything in life that we dont accept will simply make trouble for us until we make peace with it

Often the prudent far from making their destinies succumb to them

Things past redress are now with me past care

What we call reality is an agreement that people have arrived at to make life more livable

He who has calmly reconciled his life to fate can look fortune in the face

No rose without a thorn

Life leaps like a geyser for those who drill through the rock of inertia

If you want a place in the sun youve got to put up with a few blisters

Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly

Nature to be commanded must be obeyed

The first step toward change is acceptance Once you accept yourself you open the door to change Thats all you have to do Change is not something you do its something you allow

Keep doing what youre doing and youll keep getting what youre getting

Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change So suffering must become love That is the mystery

We cannot change anything unless we accept it Condemnation does not liberate it oppresses

When you make your peace with authority you become authority

Ours must be the first age whose great goal on a nonmaterial plane is not fulfillment but adjustment

Woman must not accept she must challenge

We have fought this fight as long and as well as we know how We have been defeated There is now but one course to pursue We must accept the situation

Competition is about passion for perfection and passion for other people who join in this impossible quest

Better to accept whatever happens

If we cannot do what we will we must will what we can

Every man must be content with that glory which he may have at home

Every new adjustment is a crisis in selfesteem

What cannot be avoided twere childish weakness to lament or fear

I will not meddle with that which I cannot mend

I have learned to live with it all whatever happens all of it

There is no such thing as pure pleasure some anxiety always goes with it

If a ship has been sunk I cant bring it up If it is going to be sunk I cant stop it I can use my time much better working on tomorrows problem than by fretting about yesterdays Besides if I let those things get me I wouldnt last long

One of the many lessons that one learns in prison is that things are what they are and will be what they will be

Part of the happiness of life consists not in fighting battles but in avoiding them A masterly retreat is in itself a victory

A flower falls even though we love it A weed grows even though we dont love it

Acceptance says True this is my situation at the moment Ill look unblinkingly at the reality of it But Ill also open my hands to accept willingly whatever a loving Father sends me

Man is a pliant animal a being who gets accustomed to anything

The unknown is what it is And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that Unknown is what it is Accept that its unknown and its plain sailing

Happiness is experienced when your life gives you what you are willing to accept

Acceptance is the truest kinship with humanity

What must be shall be and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing

Acceptance makes any event put on a new face

There is no sense in the struggle but there is no choice but to struggle

Boys this is only a game But its like life in that you will be dealt some bad hands Take each hand good or bad and dont whine and complain but play it out If youre men enough to do that God will help and you will come out well

Practice easing your way along Dont get het up or in a dither Do your best take it as it comes You can handle anything if you think you can Just keep your cool and your sense of humor

Accept that all of us can be hurt that all of us canand surely will at timesfail Other vulnerabilities like being embarrassed or risking love can be terrifying too I think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk

Do not weep do not wax indignant Understand

We must learn to accept life and to accept ourselves with a shrug and a smile because its all weve got

I have accepted fear as a part of life specifically the fear of change I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

There are things I cant force I must adjust

Let a man accept his destiny No pity and no tears

Wood may remain ten years in the water but it will never become a crocodile

No matter how much you feed a wolf he will always return to the forest

Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots

A wise man knows everything a shrewd one everybody

Sudden acquaintance brings repentance

If a man is worth knowing at all he is worth knowing well

Anger as soon as fed is dead Tis starving makes it fat

Many people lose their tempers merely from seeing you keep yours

Men often make up in wrath what they want in reason

Anger makes dull men witty but it keeps them poor

Never answer a letter while you are angry

When angry count four when very angry swear

Cats a standing rebuke to behavioural scientists least human of all creatures

Cats seem to go on the principle that it never does any harm to ask for what you want

Animals are such agreeable friends they ask no questions they pass no criticisms

I never saw a wild thing sorry for itself

A robin redbreast in a cage Sets all heaven in a rage

I think one reason we admire cats those of us who do is their proficiency in oneupmanship They always seem to come out on top no matter what they are doing or pretend they do Rarely do you see a cat discomfited They have no conscience and they never regret Maybe we secretly envy them

I think I could turn and live with animals they are so placid and selfcontaind I stand and look at them long and long They do not sweat and whine about their condition They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God Not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania of owning things Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that liveth thousands of years ago Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth

We need not be afraid of the future for the future will be in our own hands

It is never safe to look into the future with eyes of fear

The future is called perhaps which is the only possible thing to call the future And the important thing is not to allow that to scare you

Cowardice is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend the functioning of the imagination

Anxiety is a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind If encouraged it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained

Most of the fear that spoils our life comes from attacking difficulties before we get to them

Part of being a champ is acting like a champ You have to learn how to win and not run away when you lose Everyone has bad stretches and real successes

Fear of success can also be tied into the idea that success means someone elses loss Some people are unconsciously guilty because they believe their victories are coming at the expense of another

Most people are afraid of failing I think theres nothing wrong in failing

True success is overcoming the fear of being unsuccessful

Art is much less important than life but what a poor life without it

Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life

Without art the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable

Art is a staple like bread or wine or a warm coat in winter Mans spirit grows hungry for art in the same way his stomach growls for food

The object of art is to give life a shape

The artist has a special task and duty the task of reminding men of their humanity and the promise of their creativity

Each of us is an artist capable of conceiving and creating a vision from the depths of our being

All that is good in art is the expression of one soul talking to another and is precious according to the greatness of the soul that utters it

The artist alone sees spirits But after he has told of their appearing to him everybody sees them

Artists are nearest God Into their souls he breathes his life and from their hands it comes in fair articulate forms to bless the world

A work of art has an author and yet when it is perfect it has something which is anonymous about it

The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection

The artist is the confidant of nature flowers carry on dialogues with him through the graceful bending of their stems and the harmoniously tinted nuances of their blossoms Every flower has a cordial word which nature directs towards him

Dancing is the loftiest the most moving the most beautiful of the arts because it is no mere translation or abstraction from life it is life itself

If you can walk you can dance Zimbabwe saying Music is well said to be the speech of angels

Music is the child of prayer the companion of religion

Music is the art of the prophets the only art that can calm the agitations of the soul it is one of the most magnificent and delightful presents God has given us

Musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul

We are full of rhythms our pulse our gestures our digestive tracts the lunar and seasonal cycles

When I hear music I fear no danger I am invulnerable I see no foe I am related to the earliest times and to the latest

The best most beautiful and most perfect way that we have of expressing a sweet concord of mind to each other is by music

When words leave off music begins

After silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music

Music is the universal language of mankind

There is no feeling except the extremes of fear and grief that does not find relief in music

Without music life is a journey through a desert

I merely took the energy it takes to pout and wrote some blues

God respects me when I work but loves me when I sing

We all have music inside us and can learn how to get it out one way or another

Poetry ennobles the heart and the eyes and unveils the meaning of all things upon which the heart and the eyes dwell It discovers the secret rays of the universe and restores to us forgotten paradises

To read a poem in January is as lovely as to go for a walk in June

Poetry is something to make us wiser and better by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth which God has set in all mens souls

The poem is a little myth of mans capacity of making his life meaningful And in the end the poem is not a thing we see it is rather a light by which we may see and what we see is life

Poetry is the utterance of deep and heartfelt truth The true poet is very near the oracle

The poets are only the interpreters of the gods

Poetry is simply the most beautiful impressive and widely effective mode of saying things

When power narrows the area of mans concern poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his existence

When you read and understand a poem comprehending its rich and formal meanings then you master chaos a little

There is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem

You will find poetry nowhere unless you bring some of it with you

The echo of a platitude

Applause is the spur of noble minds the end and aim of weak ones

About the only person we ever heard of that wasnt spoiled by being lionized was a Jew named Daniel

Architecture is a continuing dialogue between generations which creates an environment across time

Why cant we have those curves and arches that express feeling in design What is wrong with them Why has everything got to be vertical straight unbending only at right angles and functional

In architecture the pride of man his triumph over gravitation his will to power assume a visible form Architecture is a sort of oratory of power by means of forms

The materials of city planning are sky space trees steel and cement in that order and in that hierarchy

Buildings should be good neighbours

Pictures deface walls oftener than they decorate them

Life is rich always changing always challenging and we architects have the task of transmitting into wood concrete glass and steel of transforming human aspirations into habitable and meaningful space

A building is a string of events belonging together

Good architecture is like a piece of beautifully composed music crystallized in space that elevates our spirits beyond the limitation of time

Architecture is a theatre stage setting where the leading actors are the people and to dramatically direct the dialogue between these people and space is the technique of designing

I saw the bathroom fixtures as a kind of American Trinity

Perspective is worth 80 IQ points

Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space

When you look on one of your contemporary good copies of historical remains ask yourself the question Not what style but in what civilization is this building And the absurdity vulgarity anachronism and solecism of the modern structure will be revealed to you in a most startling fashion

Light Gods eldest daughter is a principal beauty in a building

No architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect

Architecture is inhabited sculpture

Good architecture lets nature in

How can we expect our students to become bold and fearless in thought and action if we encase them in sentimental shrines feigning a culture which has long since disappeared

The house does not frame the view it projects the beholder into it

Architecture is space structured to serve man and to move him

Take nothing for granted as beautiful or ugly but take every building to pieces and challenge every feature Learn to distinguish the curious from the beautiful Get the habit of analysis analysis will in time enable synthesis to become your habit of mind Think simples as my old master used to say meaning to reduce the whole of its parts into the simplest terms getting back to first principles

Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context a chair in a room a room in a house a house in an environment an environment in a city plan

In speculative buildings which is most of our business there are really only three chances to make architecture the lobby or entrance sequence the top and the elevator cab

A house is a machine for living

A doctor can bury his mistakes but an architect can only advise his clients to plant vines

Genius is personal decided by fate but it expresses itself by means of system There is no work of art without system

We shape our buildings thereafter they shape us

I call architecture petrified music

Form ever follows function

Old houses mended Cost little less than new before theyre ended

Architecture is frozen music

Ah to build to build That is the noblest of all the arts

Arguments out of a petty mouth are unanswerable

Many can argue not many converse

Wise men argue causes and fools decide them

When Bishop Berkeley said there was no matter And proved it twas no matter what he said

Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument

I am bound to furnish my antagonists with arguments but not with comprehension

Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause

Insolence is not logic epithets are the arguments of malice

Myself when young did eagerly frequent Doctor and Saint and heard great argument About it and about but evermore Came out by the same door where in I went

Weakness on both sides is as we know the motto of all quarrels

There is no good arguing with the inevitable The only argument available with an east wind is to put on your overcoat

It is not necessary to understand things in order to argue about them

I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig You get dirty and besides the pig likes it

The test of a man or womans breeding is how they behave in a quarrel

I have never in my life learned anything from any man who agreed with me

Better be quarrelling than lonesome

Quarrels would not last long if the fault was only on one side

When we quarrel how we wish we had been blameless

The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no good evidence either way

Every story has three sides to it yours mine and the facts

Ars longa vita brevis Art is long life is short A picture can become for us a highway between a particular thing and a universal feeling

A work of art cannot be satisfied with being a representation it should be a presentation

Artistic temperament is a disease that afflicts amateurs

Artists are the antennae of the race but the bulletheaded many will never learn to trust the great artists

Fine art is that in which the hand the head and the heart of man go together

Good artists exist simply in what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are

I think there is no work of art which represents the spirit of a nation more surely than Die Meister Singer of Richard Wagner Here is no plaything with local colour but the raising to its highest power all that is best in the national consciousness of his country

I wonder whether Art has a higher function than to make me feel appreciate and enjoy natural objects for their art value

Ive been 40 years discovering that the Queen of all colours is black

If artists and poets are unhappy it is after all because happiness does not interest them

Interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art

One of the most difficult things to do is to paint darkness which nonetheless has light in it

Painting is a faith and it imposes the duty to disregard public opinion

Style like the human body is specially beautiful when the veins are not prominent and the bones cannot be counted

The fingers must be educated the thumb is born knowing

The genuine artist is as much a dissatisfied person as the revolutionary yet how diametrically opposed are the products each distills from his dissatisfaction

The object of art is to give life a shape

The scholar seeks the artist finds

The song of the brush

Theatre takes place all the time wherever one is and art simply facilitates persuading one this is the case

Two boys arrived yesterday with a pebble they said was the head of a dog until I pointed out that it was really a typewriter

We live in a rainbow of chaos

We must grant the artist his subject his idea his donnee Our criticisms apply only to what he makes of it

Art is I science is we

The artist like the God of the creation remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork invisible refined out of existence indifferent paring his fingernails

Designers and free lance artists and editors can set their hourly rates by dividing their annual income needs by 1000

Children like animals use all their senses to discover the world Then artists come along and discover it the same way all over again

When power leads man toward arrogance poetry reminds him of his limitations When power narrows the areas of mans concern poetry reminds him of the richness and diversity of his experience When power corrupts poetry cleanses For art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstones of our judgement The artist faithful to his personal vision of reality becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility against an intrusive society and an offensive state

Art is the expression of an enormous preference

Conception my boy fundamental brainwork is what makes the difference in all art

An artist may visit a museum but only a pedant can live there

All profoundly original art looks ugly at first

Pioneers did not produce original works of art because they were creating original human environments they did not imagine Utopias because they were shaping them

Every child is an artist The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up

Art is mans nature nature is Gods art

With the pride of the artist you must blow against the walls of every power that exists the small trumpet of your defiance

All art is a kind of confession more or less oblique All artists if they are to survive are forced at last to tell the whole story to vomit the anguish up

History repeats itself but the special call of an art which has passed away is never reproduced It is utterly gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird

If you ask me what I came to do in this world I an artist I will answer you T am here to live out loud

Illustrations have as much to say as the text The trick is to say the same thing but in a different way Its no good being an illustrator who is saying a lot that is on his or her mind if it has nothing to do with the text the artist must override the story but he must also override his own ego for the sake of the story

In any evolutionary process even in the arts the search for novelty becomes corrupting

The cheap no matter how charming how immediate does not wear so well It has a way of telling its whole story the first time through

A work of art is a corner of creation seen through a temperament

Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life

Man in Canadian art is rarely in command of his environment or ever at home in it

Whats an artist but the dregs of his work the human shambles that follows it around

Art has no other object than to set aside the symbols of practical utility the generalities that are conventionally and socially accepted everything in fact which masks reality from us in order to set us face to face with reality itself

Every artist preserves deep within him a single source from which throughout his lifetime he draws what he is and what he says and when the source dries up the work withers and crumbles

As an artist grows older he has to fight disillusionment and learn to establish the same relation to nature as an adult as he had when a child

Perpetual modernness is the measure of merit in every work of art

Nothing can come out of an artist that is not in the man

It is not in life but in art that selffulfillment is to be found

An artist never really finishes his work he merely abandons it

I am convinced it is a mistake to find an artist human outside his work If you cannot find him human in and through his work you are better not to know it when you come to formulate an opinion of his public value

One must work nothing but work and one must have patience

Art does not reproduce the visible rather it makes it visible

In any evolutionary process even in the arts the search for novelty becomes corrupting

The cheap no matter how charming how immediate does not wear so well It has a way of telling its whole story the first time through

Art at its most significant is a Distant Early Warning System that can always be relied on to tell the old culture what is beginning to happen to it

It is well with me only when I have a chisel in my hand

Art is based on order The world is full of sloppy Bohemians and their work betrays them

Living is a form of not being sure not knowing what next or how The moment you know how you begin to die a little The artist never entirely knows We guess We may be wrong but we take leap after leap in the dark

The artist like the idiot or clown sits on the edge of the world and a push may send him over it

Artspeech is the only truth An artist is usually a damned liar but his art if it be art will tell you the truth of his day And that is all that matters Away with eternal truth The truth lives from day to day and the marvelous Plato of yesterday is chiefly bosh today

A work should contain its total meaning within itself and should impress it on the spectator before he even knows the subject

The terror of art lies in the representation of the hidden reality with its shattering effect

Drawing is speaking to the eye talking is painting to the ear

We should comport ourselves with the masterpieces of art as with exalted personages stand quietly before them and wait till they speak to us

The painting rises from the brushstrokes as a poem rises from the words The meaning comes later

Caricature is rough truth

A work of art is an exaggeration

Art not only imitates nature but also completes its deficiencies

When one admires an artist it is important not to know him personally

Art for arts sake

Art as far as it is able follows nature as a pupil imitates his master thus your art must be as it were Gods grandchild

Great art is as irrational as great music It is mad with its own loveliness

A picture is a poem without words

No this trick wont work How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love

Love is the flower of life and blossoms unexpectedly and without law and must be plucked where it is found and enjoyed for the brief hour of its duration

First love is a kind of vaccination which saves a man from catching the complaint the second time

At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet

Love is like quicksilver in the hand Leave the fingers open and it stays Clutch it and it darts away

Love is a madness if thwarted it develops fast

Love is like war easy to begin but hard to end

Falling in love consists merely in uncorking the imagination and bottling the commonsense

I have learned not to worry about love but to honor its coming with all my heart

I believe in love but I dont sit around waiting for it

She deceiving I believing What need lovers wish for more

Curfew must not ring tonight

In my beginning is my end

When I was born I did lament and cry And now each day doth shew the reason why

Where unwilling dies the rose Buds the new another year

Husbands dont really count in the miracle of birth

And when I was born I drew in the common air and fell upon the earth which is of like nature and the first voice which I uttered was crying as all others do For all men have one entrance into life The Apocrypha Mondays child is fair of face Tuesdays child is full of grace Wednesdays child is full of woe Thursdays child has far to go Fridays child is loving and giving Saturdays child works hard for a living But the child born on the Sabbath day Is happy and wise and good and gay

As the births of living creatures at first are illshapen so are all innovations which are the births of time

After thirty a body has a mind of its own

Of all the things I miss the thing I miss the most is my mind

My health is good its my age thats bad

I stay away from natural foods At my age I need all the preservatives I can get

At eightyeight how do you feel when getting up in the morning Amazed

Wisdom doesnt automatically come with old age Nothing does except wrinkles Its true some wines improve with age But only if the grapes were good in the first place

If you can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you But make allowance for their doubting too If you can wait and not be tired by waiting Or being lied about dont deal in lies Or being hated dont give away to hating And yet dont look too good nor talk to wise If you can dream and not make dreams your master If you can think and not make thoughts your aim If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster And treat those two imposters just the same If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss And lose and start again at your beginnings And never breathe a word about your loss If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue Or walk with Kings nor lose the common touch If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you If all men count with you but none too much If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds worth of distance run Yours is the Earth and everything thats in it And which is more youll be a Man my son

Every one is as God made him and oftentimes a good deal worse

Character is that which can do without success

Character is what God and the angels know of us reputation is what men and women think of us

One can acquire everything in solitude except character

Every man has three characters that which he exhibits that which he has and that which he thinks he has

If I take care of my character my reputation will take care of itself

A wise and an understanding heart

Everyone ought to bear patiently the results of his own conduct

Every man has his follies and often they are the most interesting things he has got

Indecision is like a stepchild if he doesnt wash his hands he is called dirty if he does he is wasting the water

Tis eer the wont of simple folk to prize the deed and overlook the motive and of learned folk to discount the deed and lay open the soul of the doer

Learn to say No it will be of more use to you than to be able to read Latin

To dream of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are

Character is like a tree and reputation like its shadow The shadow is what we think of it the tree is the real thing

Not in the clamor of the crowded street Not in the shouts and plaudits of the throng But in ourselves are triumph and defeat

Who knows nothing base Fears nothing known

In men whom men condemn as ill I find so much of goodness still In men whom men pronounce divine I find so much of sin and blot I do not dare to draw a line Between the two where God has not

In this world a man must either be anvil or hammer

It is more blessed to give than to receive

Charity is the perfection and ornament of religion

Every charitable act is a stepping stone toward heaven

My poor are my best patients God pays for them

Though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing

And now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity

What we frankly give forever is our own

As the purse is emptied the heart is filled

That charity which longs to publish itself ceases to be charity

He who waits to do a great deal of good at once will never do anything

I was an hungred and ye gave me meat I was thirsty and ye gave me drink I was a stranger and ye took me in

Organized charity scrimped and iced In the name of the cautious statistical Christ

Charity shall cover the multitude of sins

Our charity begins at home And mostly ends where it begins

Steady as a clock busy as a bee and cheerful as a cricket

Im not happy Im cheerful Theres a difference A happy woman has no cares at all A cheerful woman has cares but has learned how to deal with them

The clearest sign of wisdom is continued cheerfulness

Cheerfulness is as natural to the heart of man in strong health as color to his cheek and wherever there is habitual gloom there must be either bad air unwholesome food improperly severe labor or erring habits of life

Cheerfulness prepares a glorious mind for all the noblest acts

A man of gladness seldom falls into madness

Always let them think of you as singing and dancing

Developing a cheerful disposition can permit an atmosphere wherein ones spirit can be nurtured and encouraged to blossom and bear fruit Being pessimistic and negative about our experiences will not enhance the quality of our lives

Gaiety alone as it were is the hard cash of happiness everything else is just a promissory note

I exhort you to be of good cheer

He who sings frightens away his ills

A cheerful look makes a dish a feast

Cheer up the worst is yet to come

Let us be of good cheer remembering that the misfortunes hardest to bear are those which never happen

A good laugh is sunshine in a house

Do ye hear the children weeping O my brothers

When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things

A little curlyheaded goodfornothing And mischiefmaking monkey from his birth

Better to be driven out from among men than to be disliked of children

Children should be seen and not heard

Spare the rod and spoil the child

Teach your child to hold his tongue Hell learn fast enough to speak

A wise son maketh a glad father

It is a wise child that knows his own father

Rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not

The childhood shows the man As morning shows the day

The children in Holland take pleasure in making What the children in England take pleasure in breaking

The wildest colts make the best horses

Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it

How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood When fond recollection presents them to view

I think that saving a little child And bringing him to his own Is a derned sight better business Than loafing around the throne

It is a wise father that knows his own child

It is very nice to think The world is full of meat and drink With little children saying grace In every Christian kind of place

The best way to make children good is to make them happy

The child is father of the man

A childs a plaything for an hour

An adolescent is both an impulsive child and a selfstarting adult

Beat your child once a day If you dont know why he does

Children have no use for psychology They detest sociology They still believe in God the family angels devils witches goblins logic clarity punctuation and other such obsolete stuff When a book is boring they yawn openly They dont expect their writer to redeem humanity but leave to adults such childish allusions

A child thinks twenty shillings and twenty years can scarce ever be spent

If children grew up according to early indications we should have nothing but geniuses

What children expect from grownups is not to be understood but only to be loved even though this love may be expressed clumsily or in sternness Intimacy does not exist between generations only trust

Healthy children will not fear life if their elders have integrity enough not to fear death

William Blake really is important my cornerstone Nobody ever told me before he did that childhood was such a damned serious business

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength

When I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things

Children have more need of models than of critics

Children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardour for their curiosity their intolerance of shams the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision

The events of childhood do not pass but repeat themselves like seasons of the year

Children have never been very good at listening to their elders but they have never failed to imitate them

Ask your child what he wants for dinner only if he is buying

All children wear the sign I want to be important NOW Many of our juvenile delinquency problems arise because nobody reads the sign

If a child lives with approval he learns to live with himself

Your children are not dead They are just waiting until the world deserves them

Whats done to children they will do to society

The hardest job kids face today is learning good manners without seeing any

Unlike grownups children have little need to deceive themselves

Weve had bad luck with our kids theyve all grown up

There are only two lasting bequests we can hope to give our children One of these is roots the other wings

Give me the children until they are seven and anyone may have them afterwards

There are only two things a child will share willingly communicable diseases and his mothers age

Do not mistake a child for his symptom

Babies are such a nice way to start people

Children need love especially when they do not deserve it

If a child is to keep alive his inborn sense of wonder without any such gift from the fairies he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with him the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in

Nothing has a stronger influence psychologically on their environment and especially on their children than the unlived lives of the parents

Books rarely if ever talk about what children can make of themselves about the powers that from the day or moment of birth are present in every child

I do not choose to run for President in 1928

Betwixt the devil and the deap sea

Theres small choice in rotten apples

When to elect there is but one Tis Hobsons Choice take that or none

For many are called but few are chosen

In every pang that rends the heart The Man of Sorrows had a part

The sages and heroes of history are receding from us and history contracts the record of their deeds into a narrower and narrower page But time has no power over the name and deeds and words of Jesus Christ

Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever

The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head

Jesus was made a little lower than the angels

All His glory and beauty come from within and there He delights to dwell His visits there are frequent His conversation sweet His comforts refreshing and His peace passing all understanding

Alexander Caesar Charlemagne and I myself have founded empires but upon what do these creations of our genius depend Upon force Jesus alone founded His empire upon love and to this very day millions would die for Him

If the life and death of Socrates were those of a sage the life and death of Jesus were those of a God

A Christian is God Almightys gentleman

Onward Christian soldiers Marching as to war With the cross of Jesus Going on before

Why do bornagain people so often make you wish theyd never been born the first time

Somewhere and I cant find where I read about an Eskimo hunter who asked the local missionary priest If I did not know about God and sin would I go to hell No said the priest not if you did not know Then why asked the Eskimo earnestly did you tell me

Christians have burned each other quite persuaded That all the apostles would have done as they did

Christian one who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbour

Most people believe that the Christian commandments are intentionally a little too severe like setting a clock half an hour ahead to make sure of not being late in the morning

A Christian is nothing but a sinful man who has put himself to school for Christ for the honest purpose of becoming better

I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen Not only because I see it but because I see everything by it

A Christian is a man who feels Repentance on a Sunday For what he did on Saturday And is going to do on Monday

Hatred of Judaism is at bottom hatred of Christianity

It is not by driving away our brother that we can be alone with God

God will forgive me Thats his business

Ethical man a Christian holding four aces

People in general are equally horrified at hearing the Christian religion doubted and at seeing it practised

Christian life consists of faith and charity

Many a sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God than that God is a cruel and capricious tyrant

If you go to church and like the singing better than the preaching thats not orthodox

Lets dance and sing and make good cheer For Christmas comes but once a year

0 little town of Bethlehem How still we see thee lie Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go by

No Santa Claus Thank God he lives and he lives forever A thousand years from now Virginia nay ten times ten thousand years from now he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood

I heard the bells on Christmas Day Their old familiar carols play And wild and sweet The words repeat Of peace on earth goodwill to men

For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour which is Christ the Lord

God rest ye little children let nothing you affright For Jesus Christ your Saviour was born this happy night Along the hills of Galilee the white flocks sleeping lay When Christ the Child of Nazareth was born on Christmas day

Twas the night before Christmas when all through the house Not a creature was stirring not even a mouse The stockings were hung by the chimney with care In hopes that St Nicholas soon would be there

Hark the herald angels sing Glory to the newborn king Peace on earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled

Cathedrals Luxury liners laden with souls Holding to the east their hulls of stone

It was founded upon a rock

The nearer the church the further from God

Whenever God erects a house of prayer The devil always builds a chapel there And twill be found upon examination The latter has the largest congregation

Division has done more to hide Christ from the view of men than all the infidelity that has ever been spoken

I never weary of great churches It is my favourite kind of mountain scenery Mankind was never so happily inspired as when it made a cathedral

See the Gospel Church secure And founded on a Rock All her promises are sure Her bulwarks who can shock Count her every precious shrine Tell to afterages tell Fortified by power divine The Church can never fail

The itch of disputing is the scab of the churches

The long arm of coincidence

Man is not the creature of circumstances Circumstances are the creatures of men

Circumstances alter cases

The happy combination of fortuitous circumstances

The circumstances of others seem good to us while ours seem good to others

A tourist is a fellow who drives thousands of miles so he can be photographed standing in front of his car

When we cant get away for a vacation we get the same feeling by staying home and tipping every person that smiles

One certainty when you travel is the moment you arrive in a foreign country the American dollar will fall like a stone

The trouble with all these other countries is theyre all being run by foreigners

My wife loves Europe but to me its a bad day at a theme park

This summer onethird of the nation will be illhoused illnourished and illclad Only they call it a vacation

It looks as if Hollywood brides keep the bouquets and throw away the groom

It is possible to live in San Francisco for 35000 a year Obviously that doesnt include food or lodging

LA bumper sticker Keep honking Im reloading

Miami bumper sticker My horn is brokenso watch for my finger

I have no respect for gangs today None They just drive by and shoot people At least in the old days like in West Side Story the gangs used to dance with each other

A car is useless in New York essential everywhere else The same with good manners

I feel about New York as a child whose father is a bank robber Not perfect but I still love him

New Yorkers are so impersonal if it wasnt for muggings there wouldnt be any contact at all

Living in California adds ten years to a mans life And those extra ten years Id like to spend in New York

France is the only country where the money falls apart and you cant tear the toilet paper

How can you be expected to govern a country that has 246 kinds of cheese

Good Americans when they die go to Paris

My father never lived to see his dream come true of an allYiddishspeaking Canada

London A place you go to get bronchitis

I am a citizen not of Athens or Greece but of the world

Paul said I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus a city in Cilicia a citizen of no mean city

This poor little onehorse town

If you would know and not be known live in a city

God made the country and man made the town

Cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining but they make them artificial

In the busy haunts of men

Far from gay cities and the way of men

Ye are the light of the world A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid

The people are the city

Civilization is nothing more than the effort to reduce the use of force to the last resort

Each new generation is a fresh invasion of savages

Respectability is the dickey on the bosom of civilization

The human race has improved everything except the human race

A civilized society is one that exhibits the five qualities of truth beauty adventure art and peace

There is such a thing as too much couth

We are in the first age since the dawn of civilization in which people have dared to think it practicable to make the benefits of civilization available to the whole human race

The human landscape of the New World shows a conquest of nature by an intelligence that does not love it

Let us humour if we can The vertical man Though we value none But the horizontal one

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic

Our lifetime may be the last that will be lived out in a technological society

To be able to fill leisure intelligently is the last product of civilization

So I should say that civilizations begin with religion and stoicism they end with scepticism and unbelief and the undisciplined pursuit of individual pleasure A civilization is born stoic and dies epicurean

We are all afraid for our confidence for the future for the world That is the nature of the human imagination Yet every man every civilization has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do The personal commitment and the emotional commitment working together as one has made the Ascent of Man

Civilization is just a slow process of learning to be kind

Civilization is a movement not a condition a voyage not a harbour

Since barbarism has its pleasures it naturally has its apologists

We sit by and watch the barbarian We tolerate him in the long stretches of peace we are not afraid We are tickled by his irreverence his comic inversion of our old certitudes and our fixed creed refreshes us we laugh But as we laugh we are watched by large and awful faces from beyond and on these faces there are no smiles

A race preserves its vigour so long as it harbours a real contrast between what has been and what may be and so long as it is nerved by the vigour to adventure beyond the safeties of the past Without adventure civilization is in full decay

Civilizations die from philosophical calm irony and the sense of fair play quite as surely as they die of debauchery

The three great elements of modern civilization Gunpowder Printing and the Protestant Religion

A savage is simply a human organism that has not received enough news from the human race

This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper

A tablecloth restaurant is still one of the great rewards of civilization

The end of the human race will be that it will eventually die of civilization

If you would civilize a man begin with his grandmother

To be a man is to feel that ones own stone contributes to building the edifice of the world

A sufficient measure of civilization is the influence of good women

We think our civilization near its meridian but we are yet only at the cockcrowing and the morning star

The path of civilization is paved with tin cans

Nations like individuals live and die but civilization cannot die

Civilization is a movement and not a condition a voyage and not a harbor

All will come out in the washing

Wash you make you clean

God loveth the clean

If dirt was trumps what hands you would hold

Certainly this is a duty not a sin Cleanliness is indeed next to godliness

If you would lift me you must be on a higher ground

Politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement

As a career the business of an orthodox preacher is about as successful as that of a celluloid dog chasing an asbestos cat through Hell

The life of a conscientious clergyman is not easy I have always considered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain I would rather have chancery suits upon my hands than the cure of souls

The defects of a preacher are soon spied

Cleverness is serviceable for everything sufficient for nothing

Cleverness is not wisdom

Be good sweet maid and let who will be clever

The clothes make the man

Whenas in silks my Julia goes Then then methinks how sweetly flows The liquefaction of her clothes

Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy But not expressd in fancy rich not gaudy For the apparel oft proclaims the man

The soul of this man is his clothes

She wears her clothes as if they were thrown on her with a pitchfork

The ideal committee is one with me as chairman and two other members in bed with flu

If Moses had been a committee the Israelites would still be in Egypt

A committee of one gets things done

A camel is a horse designed by a committee

If Columbus had had an advisory committee he would probably still be at the dock

An institution is the lengthening shadow of one man

I do not care to belong to a club that accepts people like me as members

Those mausoleums of inactive masculinity are places for men who prefer armchairs to women

What is a committee A group of the unwilling picked from the unfit to do the unnecessary

No grand idea was ever born in a conference but a lot of foolish ideas have died there

Life is my college May I graduate well and earn some honors

College is the best time of your life When else are your parents going to spend several thousand dollars a year just for you to go to a strange town and get drunk every night

Those who go to college and never get out are called professors

Colors speak all languages

Blue is true Yellows jealous Greens forsaken Reds brazen White is love And black is death

More pernicious nonsense was never devised by man than treaties of commerce

Commerce links all mankind in one common brotherhood of mutual dependence and interests

Commerce is the equalizer of the wealth of nations

Whatever has a tendency to promote the civil intercourse of nations by an exchange of benefits is a subject as worthy of philosophy as of politics

What distinguishes the majority of men from the few is their ability to act accordingly to their beliefs

What a man believes he will die for What a man merely thinks he will change his mind about

When you have decided what you believe what you feel must be done have the courage to stand alone and be counted

The eloquent man is he who is no beautiful speaker but who is inwardly and desperately drunk with a certain belief

A belief which does not spring from a conviction in the emotions is no belief at all

Whether you are really right or not doesnt matter its the belief that counts

Many a man has walked up to the opportunity for which he has long been preparing himself looked it full in the face and then begun to get cold feet when it comes to betting on yourself and your power to do the thing you know you must do or write yourself down a failure youre a chickenlivered coward if you hesitate

The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket

Poverty is uncomfortable as I can testify but nine times out of ten the best thing that can happen to a young man is to be tossed overboard and compelled to sink or swim for himself

Anytime you play golf for whatever youve got thats pressure Id like to see HL Hunt go out there and play for 3 billion

There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice because all you have staked will be lost if you look back Lifes point of no return

Even now we can draw back But once we cross that little bridge we must settle things by the sword

You dont know what pressure is until you play for 5 with only 2 in your pocket

The fixed determination to have acquired the warrior soul to either conquer or perish with honor is the secret of victory

In war there is no substitute for victory

Victory at all costs victory in spite of all terror victory however long and hard the road may be for without victory there is no survival

Better that we should die fighting than be outraged and dishonored Better to die than to live in slavery

I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is but it does not admit of holidays

Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster

If you start to take Vienna take Vienna

The worth of every conviction consists precisely in the steadfastness with which it is held

The moment one definitely commits oneself the Providence moves too All sorts of things occur to help that would never otherwise have occurred A stream of events issues from the decision raising unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamt would have come his way

There is no strong performance without a little fanaticism in the performer

If you dont wake up with something in your stomach every day that makes you think I want to make this movie itll never get made

We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough But the tremendous effort needed one doesnt always want to make itdoes one But what else can be done Whats the alternative What do you want most to do Thats what I have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties

I am a stranger to half measures

Perform without fail what you resolve

To say yes you have to sweat and roll up your sleeves and plunge both hands into life up to the elbows It is easy to say no even if saying no means death

What one has one ought to use and whatever he does he should do with all his might

Nothings far when one wants to get there

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might

He that rides his hobby gently must always give way to him that rides his hobby hard

Stay up and really burn the midnight oil There are no compromises

Nothing of worthy or weight can be achieved with half a mind with a faint heart and with a lame endeavor

Dont ask me to give in to this body of mine I cant afford it Between me and my body there must be a struggle until death

Morality like physical cleanliness is not acquired once and for all it can only be kept and renewed by a habit of constant watchfulness and discipline

Firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character and one of the best instruments of success Without it genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies

My face is set my gait is fast my goal is Heaven my road is narrow my way is rough my companions are few my guide is reliable my mission is clear I cannot be bought compromised detoured lured away turned back diluted or delayed I will not flinch in the face of sacrifice hesitate in the presence of adversity negotiate at the table of the enemy ponder at the pool of popularity or meander in a maze of mediocrity I wont give up shut up let up or slow up

To have no loyalty is to have no dignity and in the end no manhood

If you are ashamed to stand by your colors you had better seek another flag

Great minds have purposes others have wishes

I dont want people who want to dance I want people who have to dance

What a man wants to do he generally can do if he wants to badly enough

Never grow a wishbone daughter where your backbone ought to be

Happy are those who dream dreams and are ready to pay the price to make them come true

He turns not back who is bound to a star

One advantage of marriage it seems to me is that when you fall out of love with him or he falls out of love with you it keeps you together until you maybe fall in love again

You cant try to do things you simply must do them

I am in earnest I will not equivocate I will not excuse I will not retreat a single inch and I will be heard

If you dont make a total commitment to whatever youre doing then you start looking to bail out the first time the boat starts leaking Its tough enough getting that boat to shore with everybody rowing let alone when a guy stands up and starts putting his life jacket on

When I stand before God at the end of my life I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could say I used everything you gave me

It seems safe to say that significant discovery really creative thinking does not occur with regard to problems about which the thinker is lukewarm

If a man hasnt discovered something that he will die for he isnt fit to live

Moderation in war is imbecility

Let my name stand among those who are willing to bear ridicule and reproach for the truths sake and so earn some right to rejoice when the victory is won

Getting ahead in a difficult profession requires avid faith in yourself You must be able to sustain yourself against staggering blows There is no code of conduct to help beginners That is why some people with mediocre talent but with great inner drive go much further than people with vastly superior talent

The wonderful thing about saints is that they were human They lost their tempers got hungry scolded God were egotistical or impatient in their turns made mistakes and regretted them Still they went on doggedly blundering toward heaven

A successful marriage requires falling in love many times always with the same person

Winners are men who have dedicated their whole lives to winning

Those who love a cause are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it

Unless you can find some sort of loyalty you cannot find unity and peace in your active living

Sometimes success is due less to ability than zeal The winner is he who gives himself to his work body and soul

Now I am steelset I follow the call to the clear radiance and glow of the heights

Love me please I love you I can bear to be your friend So ask of me anything I am not a tentative person Whatever I do I give up my whole self to it

I dont care a damn for your loyal service when you think I am right when I really want it most is when you think I am wrong

Ones lifework I have learned grows with the working and the living Do it as if your life depended on it and first thing you know youll have made a life out of it A good life too

If you dont stand for something youll fall for anything

If you deny yourself commitment what can you do with your life

The person who makes a success of living is the one who sees his goal steadily and aims for it unswervingly That is dedication

Theirs is not to reason why theirs is but to do or die

Either do not attempt at all or go through with it

If you start to take Vienna take Vienna

If you arent going all the way why go at all

You can be an ordinary athlete by getting away with less than your best But if you want to be a great you have to give it all youve gotyour everything

Put your heart mind intellect and soul even to your smallest acts This is the secret of success

It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it

Men like snails lose their usefulness when they lose direction and begin to bend

It is by losing himself in the objective in inquiry creation and craft that a man becomes something

The height of your accomplishments will equal the depth of your convictions

The dedicated life is the life worth living

The secret of living is to find a pivot the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand

Theres nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos

Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous you get knocked down by traffic from both sides

He who walks in the middle of the road gets hit from both sides

I never liked the middle groundthe most boring place in the world

The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in a period of moral crisis maintain their neutrality

The man who sees both sides of an issue is very likely on the fence or up a tree

The middle of the road is where the white line is and thats the worst place to drive

The principle of neutrality has increasingly become an obsolete conception and except under very special circumstances it is an immoral and shortsighted conception

We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road They get run over

Show me a person who is not an extremist about some things who is a middleoftheroader in everything and I will show you someone who is insecure

We should not permit tolerance to degenerate into indifference

Most people are not for or against anything the first object of getting people together is to make them respond somehow to overcome inertia

There is nothing harder than the softness of indifference

I could not at any age be content to take my place by the fireside and simply look on Life was meant to be lived Curiosity must be kept alive One must never for whatever reason turn his back on life

The accomplice to the crime of corruption is frequently our own indifference

Science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them allthe apathy of human beings

The only difference between a rut and a grave is their dimensions

Were swallowed up only when we are willing for it to happen

The only place you can win a football game is on the field The only place you can lose it is in your heart

I am seeking I am striving I am in it with all my heart

He did it with all his heart and prospered

Wars may be fought with weapons but they are won by men It is the spirit of the men who follow and of the man who leads that gains the victory

It was my tongue that swore my heart is unsworn

Morale is the greatest single factor in successful wars

Nothing can resist a will which will stake even existence upon its fulfillment

Our future and our fate lie in our wills more than in our hands for our hands are but the instruments of our wills

Nothing is so common as unsuccessful men with talent They lack only determination

The will to conquer is the first condition of victory

Strength is a matter of the madeup mind

Your own resolution to success is more important than any other one thing

Common sense is very uncommon

Common sense is in spite of not the result of education

Common sense is instinct and enough of it is genius

What is a Communist One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings Idler or bungler or both he is willing To fork out his copper and pocket your shilling

The Communist is a Socialist in a violent hurry

The theory of Communism may be summed up in one sentence Abolish all private property

Communism is the exploitation of the strong by the weak In communism inequality springs from placing mediocrity on a level with excellence

If you want to read about love and marriage youve got to buy two separate books

When you are in love with someone you want to be near him all the time except when you are out buying things and charging them to him

A happy marriage is a long conversation which always seems too short

The first duty of love is to listen

You dont marry someone you can live with you marry the person who you cannot live without

Behind every successful man is a surprised woman

Love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit

My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me

Sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades but to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day ah now thats a real treat

Marriage is not a ritual or an end It is a long intricate intimate dance together and nothing matters more than your own sense of balance and your choice of partner

Love does not consist in gazing at each other but in looking outward together in the same direction

Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies

I married the first man I ever kissed When I tell this to my children they just about throw up

Love Two minds without a single thought

Tenderness emerges from the fact that the two persons longing as all individuals do to overcome the separateness and isolation to which we are all heir because we are individuals can participate in a relationship that for the moment is not of two isolated selves but a union

I recently read that love is entirely a matter of chemistry That must be why my wife treats me like toxic waste

You cant put a price tag on love but you can on all its accessories

When you love someone all your savedup wishes start coming out

No man is truly married until he understands every word his wife is NOT saying

To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with

The whole world loves a lover is an interesting theory but a very bad legal defense

I was married by a judge I should have asked for a jury

They say love is blind and marriage is an insritution Well Im nor ready for an instirurion for rhe blind just yet

I think men who have a pierced ear are better prepared for marriage Theyve experienced pain and boughr jewelry

A woman can forgive a man for the harm he does her but she can never forgive him for the sacrifices he makes on her account

An archaeologist is the best husband a woman can have the older she gets the more interested he is in her

So heavy is the chain of wedlock that it needs two to carry it and sometimes three

In olden times sacrifices were made at the altar a custom which is still continued

Keep your eyes wide open before marriage half shut afterwards

In the race for love I was scratched

Marriage has no guarantees If thats what youre looking for go live with a car battery

To keep the fire burning brightly theres one easy rule Keep the two logs together near enough to keep each other warm and far enough apart about a fingers breadth for breathing room Good fire good marriage same rule

Look for a sweet person Forget rich

Love seems the swiftest but it is the slowest of all growths No man or woman really knows what perfect love is until they have been married a quarter of a century

One of the silliest lines ever said in a feature film came from Love Story the 1970s hit which immortalized the phrase Love means never having to say youre sorry There are few people who would actually want to share a life with someone who held that concept near and dear

Infatuation is when you think hes as sexy as Robert Redford as smart as Henry Kissinger as noble as Ralph Nader as funny as Woody Allen and as athletic as Jimmy Conners Love is when you realize that hes as sexy as Woody Allen as smart as Jimmy Connors as funny as Ralph Nader as athletic as Henry Kissinger and nothing like Robert Redford but youll take him anyway

Without love what are we worth Eightynine cents Eightynine cents worth of chemicals walking around lonely

Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat

Love is like a friendship caught on fire In the beginning a flame very pretty often hot and fierce but still only light and flickering As love grows older our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals deepburning and unquenchable

We waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love

Men love because they are afraid of themselves afraid of the loneliness that lives in them and need someone in whom they can lose themselves as smoke loses itself in the sky

When you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible

Being in love is something like poetry Certainly you can analyze it and expound its various senses and intentions but there is always something left over mysteriously hovering between music and meaning

We are so fond of each other because our ailments are the same

When I eventually met Mr Right I had no idea that his first name was Always

What is there in the vale of life Half so delightful as a wife When Friendship love and peace combine To stamp the marriage bond divine

Marrying for love may be a bit risky but it is so honest that God cant help but smile on it

Love is moral even without legal marriage but marriage is immoral without love

A virtuous wife is a mans best treasure

A wife is the joy of a mans heart

I thought I was in love once and then later I thought maybe it was just an innerear imbalance

When love is strong a man and a woman can make their bed on a swords blade When love grows weak a bed of 60 cubits is not large enough

Of all the paths that lead to a womans love Pitys the straightest

To see her is to love her And love but her forever For Nature made her what she is And never made another

We have lived and loved together Through many changing years We have shared each others gladness And wept each others tears

Being in therapy is great I spend an hour just talking about myself Its kinda like being the guy on a date

Whenever you want to marry someone go have lunch with his exwife

I sold my memoirs of my love life to Parker Brothers and they are going to make a game out of it

I have learned that only two things are necessary to keep ones wife happy First let her think shes having her own way And second let her have it

Politics doesnt make strange bedfellows marriage does

Someone asked me why women dont gamble as much as men do and I gave the commonsensical reply that we dont have as much money That was a true and incomplete answer In fact womens total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage

The secret of a happy marriage remains a secret

Ive given my memoirs far more thought than any of my marriages You cant divorce a book

Americans who make more of marrying for love than any other people also break up more of their marriages but the figure reflects not so much the failure of love as the determination of people not to live without it

The highest prize in a world of men is the most beautiful woman available on your arm and living there in her heart loyal to you

Love is what makes two people sit in the middle of a bench when there is plenty of room at both ends

A man loves his sweetheart the most his wife the best but his mother the longest

No woman ever falls in love with a man unless she has a better opinion of him than he deserves

The bravest thing that men do is love women

A woman has to love a bad man once or twice in her life to be thankful for a good one

Love is passion obsession someone you cant live without If you dont start with that what are you going to end up with Fall head over heels I say find someone you can love like crazy and wholl love you the same way back And how do you find him Forget your head and listen to your heart

One of the things my life has taught me is how important it is to try to say I love you in ways that can be preserved looked at and read when you are alone or when there is adversity or when circumstances bring separation In any case saying I love you is one of the secrets of the happy marriage that Ronnie and I have shared Ronnies letters move me to this day They are his gift to me across the years and throughout the decades of love

The most wonderful of all things in life is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a growing depth beauty and joy as the years increase This inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it It is a sort of divine accident and the most wonderful of all things in life

Tell me thy company and I will tell thee what thou art

Twos a company threes a crowd

We are in the same boat

The right hands of fellowship

Comparisons are odious

Some say compared to Bononcini That Mynheer Handels but a ninny Others aver that he to Handel Is scarcely fit to hold a candle Strange all this difference should be Twixt Tweedledum and Tweedledee

The bee and the serpent often sip from the selfsame flower

If the poor man cannot always get meat the rich man cannot always digest it

Tis always morning somewhere in the world

Nothing is pure and entire of a piece All advantages are attended with disadvantages A universal compensation prevails in all conditions of being and existence

The prickly thorn often bears soft roses

Those who complain most are most to be complained of

The usual fortune of complaint is to excite contempt more than pity

Complaint is the largest tribute Heaven receives

Compliments are only lies in court clothes

When two people compliment each other with the choice of anything each of them generally gets that which he likes least

Compliments and flattery oftenest excite my contempt by the pretension they imply for who is he that assumes to flatter me To compliment often implies an assumption of superiority in the complimenter It is in fact a subtle detraction

All government indeed every human benefit and enjoyment every virtue and every prudent act is founded on compromise and barter

Compromise makes a good umbrella but a poor roof it is a temporary expedient often wise in party politics almost sure to be unwise in statesmanship

Better bend than break

No man was ever so much deceived by another as by himself

The art of making much show with little substance

Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit There is more hope of a fool than of him

The ability to concentrate and to use your time well is everything

It is only when I dally with what I am about look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward that I feel these cold sinkings of the heart

A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective

Nothing interferes with my concentration You could put on an orgy in my office and I wouldnt look up Well maybe once

To be able to concentrate for a considerable time is essential to difficult achievement

If there is anything that can be called genius it consists chiefly in the ability to give that attention to a subject which keeps it steadily in the mind till we have surveyed it accurately on all sides

If you dont concentrate youll end up on your rear

If I have ever made any valuable discoveries it has been owing more to patient attention than to any other talent

For him who has no concentration there is no tranquility

The secret to success in any human endeavor is total concentration

The secret of concentration is the secret of selfdiscovery You reach inside yourself to discover your personal resources and what it takes to match them to the challenge

Beware of dissipating your powers strive constantly to concentrate them

One arrow does not bring down two birds

No horse gets anywhere until he is harnessed No steam or gas ever drives anything until it is confined No Niagara is ever turned into light and power until it is tunneled No life ever grows great until it is focused dedicated disciplined

A man may be so much of everything that he is nothing of everything

Concentrate your energies your thoughts and your capital The wise man puts all his eggs in one basket and watches the basket

One man two loves No good ever comes of that

One cannot both feast and become rich

The perplexity of life arises from there being too many interesting things in it for us to be interested properly in any of them

No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time

The field of consciousness is tiny It accepts only one problem at a time

To do two things at once is to do neither

I like to laugh but on the court it is my work I try to smile but it is so difficult I concentrate on the ball not on my face

Successful minds work like a gimlet to a single point

A bird can roost but on one branch A mouse can drink no more than its fill from a river

Each man is capable of doing one thing well If he attempts several he will fail to achieve distinction in any

This one thing I do I press toward the mark

All good is gained by those whose thought and life are kept pointed close to one main thing not scattered abroad upon a thousand

The first law of success is concentration to bend all the energies to one point and to go directly to that point looking neither to the right nor the left

Give me a man who says this one thing I do and not these fifty things I dabble in

A single idea if it is right saves us the labor of an infinity of experiences

One thought driven home is better than three left on base

Purity of heart is to will one thing

A man should remove not only unnecessary acts but also unnecessary thoughts for then superfluous activity will not follow

No man will swim ashore and take his baggage with him

Many people who wonder why they dont amount to more than they do have good stuff in them and are energetic persevering and have ample opportunities It is all a case of trimming the useless branches and throwing the whole force of power into the development of something that counts

A great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism and spends his energies upon that

While the work or play is on dont constantly feel you ought to be doing the other

When one is learning one should not think of play and when one is at play one should not think of learning

The immature mind hops from one thing to another the mature mind seeks to follow through

If you want to hit a bird on the wing you must have all your will in focus you must not be thinking about yourself and equally you must not be thinking about your neighbor you must be living in your eye on that bird Every achievement is a bird on the wing

The difference in men does not lie in the size of their hands nor in the perfection of their bodies but in this one sublime ability of concentration to throw the weight with the blow to live an eternity in an hour

I go at what I am about as if there was nothing else in the world for the time being

Choice of attention to pay attention to this and ignore that is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer

Concentration is everything On the day Im performing I dont hear anything anyone says to me

The real essence of work is concentrated energy

You cant ring the bells and at the same time walk in the procession

Ive learned ruthless concentration I can write under any circumstances street noises loud talk music you name it

Do whatever you do intensely

The effectiveness of work increases according to geometrical progression if there are no interruptions

Other peoples interruptions of your work are relatively insignificant compared with the countless times you interrupt yourself

If you direct your whole thought to work itself none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind

A full mind is an empty baseball bat

There is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time

If you direct your whole thought to work itself none of the things which invade eyes or ears will reach the mind

Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid

Attention to a subject depends upon our interest in it

I cant concentrate on golf or bowling Those bowling pins arent going to hurt me I can concentrate in the ring because someone is trying to kill me

When I come into a game in the bottom of the ninth bases loaded no one out and a onerun lead it takes people off my mind

Concentrate on finding your goal then concentrate on reaching it

Those who set out to serve both God and Mammon soon discover that there is no God

When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully

Be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath

The integrity of men is to be measured by their conduct not by their professions

Open confession is good for the soul

To confess a fault freely is the next thing to being innocent of it

The confidence which we have in ourselves gives birth to much of that which we have in others

Society is built upon trust

Be courteous to all but intimate with few and let those few be well tried before you give them your confidence

Every man in it is a great man an orator a critic a statesman and therefore every man upon every question must show his oratory his criticism and his political abilities

Fleas can be taught nearly anything that a Congressman can

Some statesmen go to Congress and some go to jail It is the same thing after all

How grand is victory but how dear

He who surpasses or subdues mankind must look down on the hate of those below

I came I saw I conquered

To rejoice in conquest is to rejoice in murder

Selfconquest is the greatest of victories

Conscience is a motherinlaw whose visit never ends

Conscience is a cur that will let you get past it but that you cannot keep from barking

Conscience is but a word that cowards use Devised at first to keep the strong in awe

Conscience reigns but it does not govern

A mans vanity tells him what is honour a mans conscience what is justice

Conscience does make cowards of us all

Conscience is thoroughly wellbred and soon leaves off talking to those who do not wish to hear it

Conscience is a coward and those faults it has not strength enough to prevent it seldom has justice enough to accuse

I feel bad that I dont feel worse

Shame arises from the fear of man conscience from the fear of God

Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell The tortures of that inward hell

The only incorruptible thing about us

Liberty of conscience when people have consciences is rightly considered the most indispensable of liberties

There is no pillow so soft as a clear conscience

Conscience is a sacred sanctuary where God alone may enter as judge

I am more afraid of my own heart than of the pope and all his cardinals I have within me the great pope self

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied oer with the pale cast of thought And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry And lose the name of action

The soft whispers of the God in man

A statesman who is enamored of existing evils as distinquished from the Liberal who wishes to replace them with others

We are reformers in spring and summer in autumn and winter we stand by the old reformers in the morning conservers at night Reform is affirmative conservatism negative conservatism goes for comfort reform for truth

A conservative is a man who will not look at the new moon out of respect for that ancient institution the old one

What is conservatism Is it not adherence to the old and tried against the new and untried

Inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent

Nothing that is not a real crime makes a man appear so contemptible and little in the eyes of the world as inconsistency

Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing ones mind

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall Speak what you think now in hard words and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict everything you said today

Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago

Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative

Conservatism is the maintenance of conventions already in force

There are those who would misteach us that to stick in a rut is consistency and a virtue and that to climb out of the rut is inconsistency and a vice

People who honestly mean to be true really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be consistent

The only man who can change his mind is the man whos got one

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines

Inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent

Shoemaker stick to your last

Constitutions should consist only of general provisions the reason is that they must necessarily be permanent and that they cannot calculate for the possible change of things

We are under a Constitution but the Constitution is what the judges say it is

In questions of power let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution

A good constitution is infinitely better than the best despot

Enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another

I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans happiness glad of other mens good content with my harm

He is well paid that is well satisfied

It is not for man to rest in absolute contentment

No great advance has ever been made in science politics or religion without controversy

If a cause be good the most violent attack of its enemies will not injure it so much as an injudicious defense of it by its friends

Conversation is the fine art of mutual consideration and communication about matters of common interest that basically have some human importance

Great talkers are trying to fill the gap between themselves and others but only widen it

Half the world is composed of people who have something to say and cant and the other half who have nothing to say and keep on saying it

Pollution is nothing but the resources we are not harvesting We allow them to disperse because we have been ignorant of their value

Speech is civilization itself

The habit of common and continuous speech is a symptom of mental deficiency It proceeds from not knowing what is going on in other peoples minds

The time to stop talking is when the other person nods his head affirmatively but says nothing

There is no such thing as conversation It is an illusion There are intersecting monologues That is all

He was one of those men whose constitutional inability to make small talk forfeits all ones sympathy and makes one think that social grace is sometimes a moral duty

He Macaulay has occasional flashes of silence that make his conversation perfectly delightful

As I got warmed up and felt perfectly at home in talk I heard myself boasting lying exaggerating Oh not deliberately far from it It would be unconvivial and dull to stop and arrest the flow of talk and speak only after carefully considering whether I was telling the truth

Men always talk about the most important things to perfect strangers

Not a sentence or a word is independent of the circumstances under which it is uttered

Communication is and should be hell fire and sparks as well as sweetness and light

The really important things are said over cocktails and are never done

You never say a word of yourself dear Lady Grey You have that dreadful sin of antiegotism

The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing in the right place but to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment

Listen or thy tongue will keep thee deaf

People love to talk but hate to listen Listening is not merely not talking though even that is beyond most of our powers it means taking a vigorous human interest in what is being told us You can listen like a blank wall or like a splendid auditorium where every sound comes back fuller and richer

A man who listens because he has nothing to say can hardly be a source of inspiration The only listening that counts is that of the talker who alternately absorbs and expresses ideas

When I think over what I have said I envy dumb people

That is the happiest conversation where there is no competition no vanity but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments

John Wesleys conversation is good but he is never at leisure He is always obliged to go at a certain hour This is very disagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have his talk out as I do

She had lost the art of conversation but not unfortunately the power of speech

Too much agreement kills a chat

You can never hope to become a skilled conversationalist until you learn how to put your foot tactfully through the television set

Some persons talk simply because they think sound is more manageable than silence

While the right to talk may be the beginning of freedom the necessity of listening is what makes the right important

Listening is a magnetic and strange thing a creative force The friends who listen to us are the ones we move toward and we want to sit in their radius When we are listened to it creates us makes us unfold and expand

A ceremony of selfwastage good talkers are miserable they know that they have betrayed themselves that they have taken material which should have a life of its own to disperse it in noises upon the air

Wit is the salt of conversation not the food

Debate is masculine conversation is feminine

Never hold any one by the button or the hand in order to be heard out for if people are unwilling to hear you you had better hold your tongue than them

Conversation enriches the understanding but solitude is the school of genius

Silence is one great art of conversation

Conceit causes more conversation than wit

The less men think the more they talk

A conservative believes nothing should be done for the first time

Now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen

Genuine blasphemy genuine in spirit and not purely verbal is the product of partial belief and is as impossible to the complete atheist as to the perfect Christian

I believe in the gods Or rather I believe that I believe in the gods But I dont believe that they are great brooding presences watching over us I believe they are completely absentminded

I think that a society cannot live without a certain number of irrational beliefs They are protected from criticism and analysis because they are irrational

What is dangerous about extremists is not that they are extreme but that they are intolerant The evil is not what they say about their cause but what they say about their opponents

It is a perplexing and unpleasant truth that when men already have something worth fighting for they do not feel like fighting

Martyrdom has always been a proof of the intensity never of the correctness of a belief

Belief is better than anything else and it is best when rapt above paying its respects to anybodys doubt whatsoever

The peak of tolerance is most readily achieved by those who are not burdened with convictions

A belief is not merely an idea the mind possesses it is an idea that possesses the mind

Every man who attacks my belief diminishes in some degree my confidence in it and therefore makes me uneasy and I am angry with him who makes me uneasy

Penetrating so many secrets we cease to believe in the unknowable But there it sits nevertheless calmly licking its chops

Believe not your own brother believe instead your own blind eye

Whether you are really right or not doesnt matter its the belief that counts

I love an opposition that has convictions

Every man wherever he goes is encompassed by a cloud of comforting convictions which move with him like flies on a summer day

Convictions are the mainsprings of action the driving powers of life What a man lives are his convictions

The best lack all conviction while the worst Are full of passionate intensity

Conviction is possible only in a world more primitive than ours can be perceived to be A man can achieve a simply gnomic conviction only by ignoring the radical describers of his environment or by hating them as convinced men have hated say Darwin and Freud as agents of some devil

Those who serve a cause are not those who love that cause They are those who love the life which has to be led in order to serve it except in the case of the very purest and they are rare

The great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving

Orthodoxy is my doxy heterodoxy is another mans doxy

Every dogma has its day

A man can believe in a considerable deal of rubbish and yet go about his daily work in a rational and cheerful manner

Every life is a possession of faith and exercises an inevitable and silent propaganda

Everyone will be taxed according to his means

I discovered I always have choices and sometimes its only a choice of attitude

The burden is equal to the horses strength

Experience shows that exceptions are as true as rules

What we call reality is an agreement that people have arrived at to make their lives more livable

All we are asked to bear we can bear That is a law of the spiritual life The only hindrance to the working of this law as of all benign laws is fear

When it comes to the pinch human beings are heroic

The incurable ills are the imaginary ills

However confused the scene of our life appears however torn we may be who now do face that scene it can be faced and we can go on to be whole

A change of heart is the essence of all other change and it has brought about me a reeducation of the mind

The human spirit is stronger than anything that can happen to it

What one has to do usually can be done

Man performs and engenders so much more than he can or should have to bear Thats how he finds that he can bear anything

If you have enough fantasies youre ready in the event that something happens

The peril of the hour moved the British to tremendous exertions just as always in a moment of extreme danger things can be done which had previously been thought impossible Mortal danger is an effective antidote for fixed ideas

We all carry it within us supreme strength the fullness of wisdom unquenchable joy It is never thwarted and cannot be destroyed

Within us all there are wells of thought and dynamos of energy which are not suspected until emergencies arise Then oftentimes we find that it is comparatively simple to double or triple our former capacities and to amaze ourselves by the results achieved

The spirit of man is an inward flame a lamp the world blows upon but never puts out

We have what we seek It is there all the time and if we give it time it will make itself known to us

Truth is not introduced into the individual from without but was within him all the time

Nature arms each man with some faculty which enables him to do easily some feat impossible to any other

When we know what we want to prove we go out and find our facts They are always there

Nature reacts not only to physical disease but also to moral weakness when the danger increases she gives us greater courage

rouble creates a capacity to handle it

Trouble like the hill ahead straightens out when you advance upon it

In the darkest hour the soul is replenished and given strength to continue and endure

Our energy is in proportion to the resistance it meets We attempt nothing great but from a sense of the difficulties we have to encounter we persevere in nothing great but from a pride in overcoming them

We shall draw from the heart of suffering itself the means of inspiration and survival

Exigencies create the necessary ability to meet and conquer them

The moment one definitely commits oneself then Providence moves too All sorts of things occur to help that would never otherwise have occurred A stream of events issues from the decision raising unforeseen incidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamt would have come his way

In forty hours I shall be in battle with little information and on the spur of the moment will have to make the most momentous decisions But I believe that ones spirit enlarges with responsibility and that with Gods help I shall make them and make them right

Often the test of courage is not to die but to live

A man of courage is also full of faith

When moral courage feels that it is in the right there is no personal daring of which it is incapable

Fortune and Love befriend the bold

Women and men of retiring timidity are cowardly only in dangers which affect themselves but the first to rescue when others are endangered

Hail Caesar those who are about to die salute thee

The small courtesies sweeten life the greater ennoble it

A moral sensible and wellbred man Will not affront me and no other can

He who fights and runs away May live to fight another day But he who is in battle slain Can never rise to fight again

A cowardly act What do I care about that You may be sure that I should never fear to commit one if it were to my advantage

A cowardly cur barks more fiercely than it bites

All men would be cowards if they durst

One who in a perilous emergency thinks with his legs

Personal liberty is the paramount essential to human dignity and human happiness

Hereditary boundsmen Know ye not Who would be free themselves must strike the blow

And Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell

In a free country there is much clamor with little suffering in a despotic state there is little complaint with much grievance

For what avail the plough or sail Or land or life if freedom fail

Ay call it holy ground The soil where first they trod They have left unstained what there they found Freedom to worship God

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me As He died to make men holy let us die to make men free While God is marching on

I am for freedom of religion and against all maneuvers to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect over another

And ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free

Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves and under a just God cannot long retain it

That this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom

Since the general civilization of mankind I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations

The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it

We must be free or die who speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake the faith and morals hold Which Milton held

No amount of political freedom will satisfy the hungry masses

I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than to be crowded on a velvet cushion

I never saw a Purple Cow I never hope to see one But I can tell you anyhow Id rather see than be one

There was an old man who said How Shall I flee from this horrible cow I will sit on this stile and continue to smile Which may soften the heart of that cow

The reality is that changes are coming They must come You must share in bringing them

After youve done a thing the same way for two years look it over carefully After five years look at it with suspicion And after ten years throw it away and start all over

All that philosophers have done is interpret the world in different ways It is our job to change it

Christians are supposed not merely to endure change nor even to profit by it but to cause it

If you have no will to change it you have no right to criticize it

Changes are not predictable but to deny them is to be an accomplice to ones own unnecessary vegetation

We must learn to view change as a natural phenomenonto anticipate it and to plan for it The future is ours to channel in the direction we want to go we must continually ask ourselves What will happen if or better still How can we make it happen

One must change ones tactics every ten years if one wishes to maintain ones superiority

New things cannot come where there is no room

The important thing is this to be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become

When patterns are broken new worlds emerge

One must lose ones life in order to find it

This Mouse must give up one of his Mouse ways of seeing things in order that he may grow

Compromise if not the spice of life is its solidity

The only alternative to war is peace and the only road to peace is negotiations

Every one should keep a mental wastepaper basket and the older he grows the more things he will consign to ittorn up to irrecoverable tatters

Unless one says goodbye to what one loves and unless one travels to completely new territories one can expect merely a long wearing away of oneself and an eventual extinction

How does one become a butterfly she asked pensively You must want to fly so much that you are willing to give up being a caterpillar

No matter how far you have gone on a wrong road turn back

Duration is not a test of true or false

It is only an error in judgement to make a mistake but it shows infirmity of character to adhere to it when discovered

If you board the wrong train it is no use running along the corridor in the other direction

Its never too latein fiction or in lifeto revise

Any path is only a path and there is no affront to oneself or to others in dropping it if that is what your heart tells you

There is a time for departure even when theres no certain place to go

Being stuck is a position few of us like We want something new but cannot let go of the oldold ideas beliefs habits even thoughts We are out of contact with our own genius Sometimes we know we are stuck sometimes we dont In both cases we have to do something

My success was not based so much on any great intelligence but on great common sense

Lose yourself wholly and the more you lose the more you will find

Heroes take journeys confront dragons and discover the treasure of their true selves

Lifes challenges are not supposed to paralyze you theyre supposed to help you discover who you are

Just as we outgrow a pair of trousers we outgrow acquaintances libraries principles etc at times before theyre worn out and timesand this is the worst of allbefore we have new ones

It is best to learn as we go not go as we have learned

Those interested in perpetuating present conditions are always in tears about the marvelous past that is about to disappear without having so much as a smile for the young future

I will not change just to court popularity

Innovation One cannot be forever innovating I want to create classics

Have no fear of change as such and on the other hand no liking for it merely for its own sake

If you want to stand out dont be different be outstanding

The main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything or nothing

To change and to improve are two different things

Our fathers valued change for the sake of its results we value it in the act

We must beware of needless innovations especially when guided by logic

All change is not growth as all movement is not forward

Just because everything is different doesnt mean anything has changed

None are happy but by the anticipation of change The change itself is nothing when we have made it the next wish is to change again

We accept the verdict of the past until the need for change cries out loudly enough to force upon us a choice between the comforts of further inertia and the irksomeness of action

To some will come a time when change itself is beauty if not heaven

Today is not yesterday how can our works and thoughts if they are always to be the fittest continue always the same Change indeed is painful yet ever needful

Security can only be achieved through constant change through discarding old ideas that have outlived their usefulness and adapting others to current facts

You had better be ready to change your mind when needed

Loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul

They were so strong in their beliefs that there came a time when it hardly mattered what exactly those beliefs were they all fused into a single stubbornness

We are chameleons and our partialities and prejudices change place with an easy and blessed facility

Our firmest convictions are apt to be the most suspect they mark our limitations and our bounds Life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries

It often takes more courage to change ones opinion than to stick to it

All our final resolutions are made in a state of mind which is not going to last

Its an ill plan that cannot be changed

The death of dogma is the birth of reality

If anyone accuses me of contradicting myself I reply Because I have been wrong once or oftener I do not aspire to be always wrong

He who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to change reality

It is in the uncompromisingness with which dogma is held and not in the dogma or want of dogma that the danger lies

I wish to say what I think and feel today with the proviso that tomorrow perhaps I shall contradict it all

Progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything

The most significant change in a persons life is a change of attitude Right attitudes produce right actions

You had better be ready to change your mind when needed or your mind will change you

The most fatal illusion is the settled point of view Since life is growth and motion a fixed point of view kills anybody who has one

The world does not have to change The only thing that has to change is our attitude

Oh would that my mind could let fall its dead ideas as the tree does its withered leaves

Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines

A man should never be ashamed to own that he has been in the wrong which is but saying that he is wiser today than yesterday

We have to live today by what truth we can get today and be ready tomorrow to call it falsehood

It is well for people who think to change their minds occasionally in order to keep them clean For those who do not think it is best at least to rearrange their prejudices once in a while

New opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common

Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradict myself I am large I contain multitudes

I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be new views

Contradiction is not a sign of falsity nor the lack of contradiction a sign of truth

My opinion is a view I hold until well until I find something that changes it

He that never changes his opinions and never corrects his mistakes will never be wiser on the morrow than he is today

Inconsistency is the only thing in which men are consistent

There is nothing in this world constant but inconstancy

Consistency is only suitable for ridicule

The world is quite right It does not have to be consistent

The worlds a scene of changes and to be constant in nature is inconstancy

We cannot remain consistent with the world save by growing inconsistent with our past selves

Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative

The world is quite right It does not have to be consistent

True consistency that of the prudent and the wise is to act in conformity with circumstances and not to act always the same way under a change of circumstances

Consistency is a paste jewel that only cheap men cherish

Consistency requires you to be as ignorant today as you were a year ago

Consistency is contrary to nature contrary to life The only completely consistent people are the dead

There are those who would misteach us that to stick in a rut is consistency and a virtue and that to climb out of the rut is inconsistency and a vice

Too much consistency is as bad for the mind as for the body

With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do Speak what you think today in words as hard as cannon balls and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradicts everything you said today

People who honestly mean to be true really contradict themselves much more rarely than those who try to be consistent

To be honest one must be inconsistent

The only man who cant change his mind is a man who hasnt got one

Like all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing ones mind

Nothing should be permanent except struggle with the dark side within ourselves

The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion

A fanatic is one who cant change his mind and wont change the subject

The circumstances of the world are so variable that an irrevocable purpose or opinion is almost synonymous with a foolish one

If in the last few years you havent discarded a major opinion or acquired a new one check your pulse You may be dead

A stiff attitude is one of the phenomena of rigor mortis

Those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth

Its the most unhappy people who most fear change

Obstinacy and heat in sticking to ones opinions is the surest proof of stupidity Is there anything so cocksure so immovable so disdainful so contemplative so solemn and serious as an ass

The man who never alters his opinion is like standing water and breeds reptiles of the mind

When people are least sure they are often most dogmatic

A conclusion is a place where you got tired of thinking

Only fools and dead men dont change their minds Fools wont Dead men cant

The consistent thinker is either a walking mummy or else if he has not succeeded in stifling all his vitality a fanatical monomaniac

Life is not a static thing The only people who do not change their minds are incompetents in asylums and those in cemeteries

To hold the same views at forty as we held at twenty is to have been stupefied for a score of years and to take rank not as a prophet but as an unteachable brat well birched and none the wiser

To do things today exactly the way you did them yesterday saves thinking

Any change even a change for the better is always accompanied by drawbacks and discomforts

Old habits are strong and jealous

Every new adjustment is a crisis in selfesteem

Every new truth begins in a shocking heresy

Birth is violent whether it be the birth of a child or the birth of an idea

Any truth creates a scandal

Even in slight things the experience of the new is rarely without some stirring of foreboding

Change is not made without inconvenience even from worse to better

All changes even the most longed for have their melancholy for what we leave behind us is a part of ourselves we must die to one life before we can enter into another

The key to change is to let go of fear

Tears are sometimes an inappropriate response to death When a life has been lived completely honestly completely successfully or just completely the correct response to deaths perfect punctuation mark is a smile

Since changes are going on anyway the great thing is to learn enough about them so that we will be able to lay hold of them and turn them in the direction of our desires Conditions and events are neither to be fled from nor passively acquiesced in they are to be utilized and directed

He that has energy enough to root out a vice should go further and try to plant a virtue in its place

To change skins evolve into new cycles I feel one has to learn to discard If one changes internally one should not continue to live with the same objects They reflect ones mind and psyche of yesterday I throw away what has no dynamic living use

Today changes must come fast and we must adjust our mental habits so that we can accept comfortably the idea of stopping one thing and beginning another overnight We must assume that there is probably a better way to do almost everything We must stop assuming that a thing which has never been done before probably cannot be done at all

We must therefore take account of this changeable nature of things and of human institutions and prepare for them with enlightened foresight

You dont have to be afraid of change You dont have to worry about whats being taken away Just look to see whats been added

When youre stuck in a spiral to change all aspects of the spin you need only to change one thing

The first step toward change is acceptance Once you accept yourself you open the door to change Thats all you have to do Change is not something you do its something you allow

The more things change the more they remain the same

Things good in themselves perfectly valid in the integrity of their origins become fetters if they cannot alter

Change lays her hand not upon the truth

The spectacle has changed but our eyes remain the same

Change is the constant the signal for rebirth the egg of the phoenix

Change is what people fear most

Change means the unknown

Natures mighty law is change

A human being does not cease to exist at death It is change not destruction which takes place

The old order changeth yielding place to new and God fulfills himself in many ways

Everybody thinks of changing humanity and nobody thinks of changing himself

One persons constant is another persons variable

The mill wheel turns it turns forever though what is uppermost remains not so

Its a bad plan that cant be changed

In a way winter is the real spring the time when the inner things happen the resurge of nature

Mourning is not forgetting It is an undoing Every minute tie has to be untied and something permanent and valuable recovered and assimilated from the dust

It is never any good dwelling on goodbyes It is not the being together that it prolongs it is the parting

Such is the state of life that none are happy but by the anticipation of change The change itself is nothing When we have made it the next wish is to change again

New links must be forged as old ones rust

The hearts of great men can be changed

You cannot step twice into the same river for other waters are continually flowing on

Without imagination nothing is dangerous

Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change

The moment of change is the only poem

I have accepted fear as a part of lifespecifically the fear of change I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

As we learn we always change and so our perception This changed perception then becomes a new Teacher inside each of us

We are restless because of incessant change but we would be frightened if change were stopped

One must be thrust out of a finished cycle in life and that leap is the most difficult to maketo part with ones faith ones love when one would prefer to renew the faith and recreate the passion

When one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us

If you want to make enemies try to change something

God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference

The art of creation is older than the art of killing

Human Salvation lies in the hands of the creatively maladjusted

I do not seek I find

The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn

Nature they say doth dote And cannot make a man Save on some wornout plan Repeating us by rote

All are but parts of one stupendous whole Whose body Nature is and God the soul

It is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a Being beyond its limits capable of creating it

The world embarrasses me and I cannot dream That this watch exists and has no watchmaker

God is in the world or nowhere creating continually in us and around us Insofar as man partakes of this creative process does he partake of the divine of God and that participation is his immortality

You were placed on this earth to create not to compete

Every moment of your life is infinitely creative and the universe is endlessly bountiful ust put forth a clear enough request and everything your heart truly desires must come to you

There is no greater joy than that of feeling oneself a creator The triumph of life is expressed by creation

Creativity is a central source of meaning in our lives most of the things that are interesting important and human are the results of creativity when we are involved in it we feel that we are living more fully than during the rest of life

If you are seeking creative ideas go out walking Angels whisper to a man when he goes for a walk

The study of crime begins with the knowledge of oneself

He only may chastise who loves

If England treats her criminals the way she has treated me she doesnt deserve to have any

It is fairly obvious that those who are in favour of the death penalty have more affinity with assassins than those who are not

Prisons dont rehabilitate they dont punish they dont protect so what the hell do they do

Capital punishment is as fundamentally wrong as a cure for crime as charity is wrong as a cure for poverty

The reformative effect of punishment is a belief that dies hard chiefly I think because it is so satisfying to our sadistic impulses

We enact many laws that manufacture criminals and then a few that punish them

Of all the cants which are canted in this canting world though the cant of hypocrites ihay be the worst the cant of criticism is the most tormenting

A guest sees more in an hour than the host in a year

Asking a working writer what he thinks about critics is like asking a lamppost how it feels about dogs

Book reviewers are little old ladies of both sexes

Constant indiscriminate approval devalues because it is so predictable

Two and two continue to make four in spite of the whine of the amateur for three or the cry of the critic for five

Tomorrow night I appear for the first time before a Boston audience 4000 critics

Danger for dangers sake is senseless

The pitcher that goes too often to the well is broken at last

A timid person is frightened before a danger a coward during the time and a courageous person afterwards

Who dares nothing need hope for nothing

No one reaches a high position without daring

When it is dark enough you can see the stars

A blind man in a dark room looking for a black hat which isnt there

Darkness is strong and so is Sin But surely God endures forever

Fear is the dark room in which negatives are developed

Even a small star shines in the darkness

It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness

Flowers grow out of dark moments

The dreadful dead of dark midnight

Darkness is strong and so is Sin But surely God endures forever

Flowers grow out of dark moments

The dreadful dead of dark midnight

It is always darkest just before the day dawneth

My son is my son till he have got him a wife But my daughters my daughter all the days of her life

If thy daughter marry well thou hast found a son if not thou hast lost a daughter

Tis of the tears which stars weep sweet with joy

Every dewdrop and raindrop had a whole heaven within it

Think that day lost whose low descending sun Views from thy hand no noble action done

For memry has painted this perfect day With colors that never fade And we find at the end of a perfect day The soul of a friend weve made

What a day may bring a day may take away

Monday for wealth Tuesday for health Wednesday the best day of all Thursday for crosses Friday for losses Saturday no luck at all

One glance of Thine creates a day

Death twitches my ear Live he says I am coming

To die is a debt we must all of us discharge

Here lies Jack Williams He done his damndest

As long as I have a want I have a reason for living Satisfaction is death

For death begins with lifes first breath And life begins at touch of death

As men we are all equal in the presence of death

At last God caught his eye

Death the last voyage the longest the best

Death is a delightful hidingplace for weary men

Death is just a distant rumour to the young

For three days after death hair and fingernails continue to grow but phone calls taper off

He mourns the dead who lives as they desire

He that dies pays all debts

Honest listening is one of the best medicines we can offer the dying and the bereaved

I believe that the struggle against death the unconditional and selfwilled determination to live is the mode of power behind the lives and activities of all outstanding men

I care not a man can die but once we owe God a death

I had a lovers quarrel with the world

In Heaven all the interesting people are missing

In Spain the dead are more alive than the dead of any other country in the world

It is a far far better thing that I do than anything I have ever done it is a far far better rest that I go to than I have ever known

Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath And after many a summer dieth the swan

It may be that we have all lived before and died and this is Hell

If there is another world he lives in bliss If there is none he made the best of this

Most persons have died before they expired died to all earthly longings so that the last breath is only as it were the locking of the door of the already deserted mansion

One short sleep past will wake eternally And death shall be no more Death thou shalt die

Rather suffer than die is mans motto

The art of living well and the art of dying well are one

The only truly dead are those who have been forgotten

The question is whether suicide is the way out or the way in

When you have told anyone you have left him a legacy the only decent thing to do is to die at once

I will be dead in a few months But it hasnt given me the slightest anxiety or worry I always knew I was going to die

Do not go gentle into that good night Old age should burn and rave at close of day Rage rage against the dying of the light

The stroke of death is as a lovers pinch Which hurts and is desired

Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it

Things have a terrible permanence when people die

A solemn funeral is inconceivable to the Chinese mind

At its most basic root the death or disintegration of ones parents is a harsh reminder of ones own mortality

I dont want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve immortality through not dying

Mausoleum n the final and funniest folly of the rich

No tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church door but tis enough twill serve ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man I am peppered I warrant for this world

Epitaph n an inscription on a tomb showing that virtues acquired by death have a retroactive effect

Human life consists in mutual service No grief pain misfortune or broken heart is excuse for cutting off ones life while any power of service remains But when all usefulness is over when one is assured of an unavoidable and imminent death it is the simplest of human rights to choose a quick and easy death in place of a slow and horrible one

Poisons pain you Rivers are damp Acid stains you And drugs cause cramp Guns arent lawful Nooses give Gas smells awful You might as well live

Dying is a wild night and a new road

The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated

And I looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was Death

There is no man so blessed that some who stand by his deathbed wont hail the occasion with delight

There may be little or much beyond the grave But the strong are saying nothing until they see

All human things are subject to decay And when fate summons monarchs must obey

When Andrew Jackson died someone asked a friend if he thought Old Hickory would go to heaven He will if he wants to was the reply On his death bed Disraeli declined a visit from Queen Victoria No it is better not he said she would only ask me to take a message to Albert I am a broken machine I am ready to go

Let the tent be struck

You can lose a man like that by your own death but not by his

Because I could not stop for Death He kindly stopped for me The carriage held but just ourselves And Immortality

When a man dies he does not just die of the disease he has he dies of his whole life

The long habit of living indisposeth us for dying

Most people would die sooner than think in fact they do

One should be ever booted and spurred and ready to depart

Who never caused others to die Seldom rates a statue

Nothing you can lose by dying is half so precious as the readiness to die which is mans charter of nobility

After sixty years the stern sentence of the burial service seems to have a meaning that one did not notice in former years There begins to be something personal about it

Death be not proud though some have called Thee Mighty and dreadful for thou art not so

Toward the person who has died we adopt a special attitude something like admiration for someone who has accomplished a very difficult task

You have to learn to do everything even to die

Im not afraid to die I just dont want to be there when it happens

Oh death you can wait keep your distance

Body and mind like man and wife do not always agree to die together

The undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns

A thousand goodbyes come after death the first six months of bereavement

You dont die in the United States you underachieve

Life is a great surprise I do not see why death should not be an even greater one

If life must not be taken too seriously then so neither must death

Death is terrible to Cicero desirable to Cato and indifferent to Socrates

In nature there is less death and destruction than death and transmutation

A mans dying is more the survivors affair than his own

I hate funerals and would not attend my Own if it could be avoided but it is well for every man to stop once in a while to think of what sort of a collection of mourners he is training for his final event

If this is dying I dont think much of it

Men use one another to assure their personal victory over death

Any mans death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee

A belief in hell and the knowledge that every ambition is doomed to frustration at the hands of a skeleton have never prevented the majority of human beings from behaving as though death were no more than an unfounded rumour and survival a thing not beyond the bounds of possibility

I cannot forgive my friends for dying I do not find these vanishing acts of theirs at all amusing

Make sure to send a lazy man for the Angel of Death

It cost me never a stab nor squirm To tread by chance upon a worm Aha my little dear I say Your clan will pay me back one day

Around around the sun we go The moon goes round the earth We do not die of death We die of vertigo

There is no such thing as death In nature nothing dies From each sad moment of decay Some forms of life arise

I am going to seek a great Perhaps

Call no man happy till he is dead

Though this may be play to you Tis death to us

Earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust in sure and certain hope of the resurrection

In the midst of life we are in death

Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live and is full of misery He cometh up and is cut down like a flower he fleeth as it were a shadow and never continueth in one stay

Death so called is a thing which makes men weep And yet a third of life is passd in sleep

Why fear death It is the most beautiful adventure in life

Now I am about to take my last voyage a great leap in the dark

Is death the last sleep No it is the last final awakening

The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the Lord

We begin to die as soon as we are born and the end is linked to the beginning

There is no death the stars go down To rise upon some other shore And bright in Heavens jeweled crown They shine for ever more

Strange is it not that of the myriads who Before us passed the door of Darkness through Not one returns to tell us of the road Which to discover we must travel too

I am dying Egypt dying

Yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep

I have a rendezvous with Death At some disputed barricade

Till tired he sleeps and lifes poor play is oer

To die to sleep No more and by a sleep to say we end The heartache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to tis a consummation Devoutly to be wished

Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it

Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field

First our pleasures die and then Our hopes and then our fears and when These are dead the debt is due Dust claims dust and we die too

Gods finger touched him and he slept

Sunset and evening star And one clear call for me And may there be no moaning of the bar When I put out to sea

Nothing can happen more beautiful than death

For he who lives more lives than one More deaths than one must die

A church debt is the devils salary

Wilt thou seal up the avenues of ill Pay every debt as if God wrote the bill

If you want the time to pass quickly just give your note for 90 days

Owe no man anything

He that dies pays all debts

A national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing

Debt is the worst poverty

Hood an ass with reverend purple So you can hide his two ambitious ears and he shall pass for a cathedral doctor

Proportion is almost impossible to human beings There is no one who does not exaggerate

Everything that deceives may be said to enchant

We are never deceived we deceive ourselves

All charming people have something to conceal usually their total dependence on the appreciation of others

You kn hide de fier but what you guine do wid de smoke

Deep versed in books and shallow in himself

Half the work that is done in the world is to make things appear what they are not

What we need is a rebirth of satire of dissent of irreverence of an uncompromising insistence that phoniness is phony and platitudes are platitudinous

If the world will be gulled let it be gulled

I give you bitter pills in sugar coating The pills are harmless the poison is in the sugar

I have known a vast quantity of nonsense talked about bad men not looking you in the face Dont trust that conventional idea Dishonesty will stare honesty out of countenance any day in the week if there is anything to be got by it

One should seek for the salutary in the unpleasant if it is there it is after all nectar One should seek for the deceitful in the pleasant if it is there it is after all poison

Deceive not thy physician confessor nor lawyer

Frank and explicit this is the right line to take when you wish to conceal your own mind and to confuse the mind of others

A delusion a mockery and a snare

We are never deceived we deceive ourselves

Which I wish to remark And my language is plain That for ways that are dark And for tricks that are vain The heathen Chinese is peculiar

Hateful to me as are the gates of hell Is he who hiding one thing in his heart Utters another

You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all the time

It is double pleasure to deceive the deceiver

Will you walk into my parlour Said the spider to a fly Tis the prettiest little parlour That ever you did spy

One is easily fooled by that which one loves

Men and women everywhere must exercise deliberate selection to live wisely

Decision and determination are the engineer and fireman of our train to opportunity and success

The last of the human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way

Choice of attention is to the inner life what choice of action is to the outer In both cases a man is responsible for his choice and must accept the consequences whatever they may be

You are the one who must choose your place

Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be what he will become in the next moment

Full maturity is achieved by realizing that you have choices to make

Wherever you see a successful business someone once made a courageous decision

Life is just a series of trying to make up your mind

Life is just an endless chain of judgements The more imperfect our judgement the less perfect our success

To know just what has do be done then to do it comprises the whole philosophy of practical life

Life is like a game of cards The hand that is dealt you represents determinism the way you play it is free will

Somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision

Living is a constant process of deciding what we are going to do

Life is the sum of all your choices

Life is the art of drawing sufficient conclusions from insufficient premises

The difficulty of life is in the choice

The strongest principle of growth lies in human choice

As a man thinketh so is he and as a man chooseth so is he

Decisions determine destiny

Choices are the hinges of destiny

Many of lifes circumstances are created by three basic choices the disciplines you choose to keep the people you chose to be with and the laws you choose to obey

You dont get to choose how youre going to die Or when You can only decide how youre going to live Now

Look for your choices pick the best one then go with it

Rules of society are nothing ones conscience is the umpire

No matter how lovesick a woman is she shouldnt take the first pill that comes along

Form the habit of making decisions when your spirit is fresh to let dark moods lead is like choosing cowards to command armies

One must either accept some theory or else believe ones own instinct or follow the worlds opinion

Decide which is the line of conduct that presents the fewest drawbacks and then follow it out as being the best one because one never finds anything perfectly pure and unmixed or exempt from danger

A problem clearly stated is a problem half solved

We must make the choices that enable us to fulfill the deepest capacities of our real selves

Choose always the way that seems the best however rough it may be custom will soon render it easy and agreeable

Where an opinion is general it is usually correct

In forty hours I shall be in battle with little information and on the spur of the moment will have to make the most momentous decisions But I believe that ones spirit enlarges with responsibility and that with Gods help I shall make them and make them right

Once the what is decided the how always follows We must not make the how an excuse for not facing and accepting the what

In each action we must look beyond the action at our past present and future state and at others whom it affects and see the relation of all those things And then we shall be very cautious

Ones mind has a way of making itself up in the background and it suddenly becomes clear what one means to do

Not all of your decisions will be correct None of us is perfect But if you get into the habit of making decisions experience will develop your judgment to a point where more and more of your decisions will be right After all it is better to be right 51 percent of the time and get something done than it is to get nothing done because you fear to reach a decision

Decide on what you think is right and stick to it

Continually one faces the horrible matter of making decisions The solution is as far as possible to avoid conscious rational decisions and choices simply to do what you find yourself doing to float in the great current of life with as little friction as possible to allow things to settle themselves as indeed they do with the most infallible certainty

When making a decision of minor importance I have always found it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons In vital matters however such as the choice of a mate or a profession the decision should come from the unconscious from somewhere within ourselves In the important decisions of personal life we should be governed I think by the deep inner needs of our nature

Pick battles big enough to matter small enough to win

Wisdom consists in being able to distinguish among dangers and make a choice of the least harmful

I think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk

Human foresight often leaves its proudest possessor only a choice of evils

When one bases his life on principle 99 percent of his decisions are already made

The best we can do is size up the chances calculate the risks involved estimate our ability to deal with them and then make our plans with confidence

In case of doubt decide in favor of what is correct

Each man must for himself alone decide what is right and what is wrong which course is patriotic and which isnt You cannot shirk this and be a man To decide against your conviction is to be an unqualified and inexcusable traitor both to yourself and to your country let men label you as they may

People died all the time Parts of them died when they made the wrong kinds of decisionsdecisions against life Sometimes they died bit by bit until finally they were just living corpses walking around If you were perceptive you could see it in their eyes the fire had gone out you always knew when you made a decision against life The door clicked and you were safe inside safe and dead

What I emphasize is for people to make choices based not on fear but on what really gives them a sense of fulfillment

We lose the fear of making decisions great and small as we realize that should our choice prove wrong we can if we will learn from the experience

History is a stern judge

I get a little angry about this highhanded scrapping of the look of things What else have we to go by How else can the average person form an opinion of a girls sense of values or even of her chastity except by the looks of her conduct

You wouldnt want to be caught wearing cheap perfume would you Then why do you want to wear cheap perfume on your conduct

The difference between weakness and wickedness is much less than people suppose and the consequences are nearly always the same

Authority without wisdom is like a heavy axe without an edge fitter to bruise than to polish

One faces the future with ones past

Our deeds still travel with us from afar and what we have been makes us what we are

You must not change one thing one pebble one grain of sand until you know what good and evil will follow on that act

The beginning of compunction is the beginning of a new life

The Pilgrims didnt have any experience when they landed here Hell if experience was that important wed never have anybody walking on the moon

Each person has a literature inside them But when people lose language when they have to experiment with putting their thoughts together on the spotthats what I love most Thats where character lives

There is no data on the future

The most important fact about Spaceship Earth an instruction book didnt come with it

Life is the only art that we are required to practice without preparation and without being allowed the preliminary trials the failures and botches that are essential for the training of a mere beginner

Time has told me less than I need to know

I learn by going where I have to go

Life is like playing a violin in public and learning the instrument as one goes on

We dont have enough time to premeditate all our actions

Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge

Faith acts promptly and boldly on the occasion on slender evidence

A decision is an action you must take when you have information so incomplete that the answer does not suggest itself

She knew in her heart that to be without optimism that core of reasonless hope in the spirit rather than the brain was a fatal flaw the seed of death

When faith is supported by facts or by logic it ceases to be faith

How far would Moses have gone if he had taken a poll in Egypt

Better to be without logic than without feeling

The will to be totally rational is the will to be made out of glass and steel and to use others as if they were glass and steel

In the three years I played ball we won six lost seventeen and tied two Some statistician calculated that we won 75 percent of the games we didnt lose

Imagination took the reins and Reason slowpaced though surefooted was unequal to a race with so eccentric and flighty a companion

Many persons of high intelligence have notoriously poor judgement

How dangerous can false reasoning prove

The tendency of modern science is to reduce proof to absurdity by continually reducing absurdity to proof

Say you were standing with one foot in the oven and one foot in an ice bucket According to the percentage people you would be perfectly comfortable

Logic is the art of going wrong with confidence

Reason with most people means their own opinions

Logic pervades the world the limits of the world are also the limits of logic

Man is a reasoning rather than a reasonable animal

False conclusions which have been reasoned out are infinitely worse than blind impulse

If you do everything you should do and do not do anything you should not do you will according to the best available statistics live exactly eighteen hours longer than you would otherwise

Decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do

Statistics are no substitute for judgement

It is the heart always that sees before the head can see

Facts are stubborn things but statistics are more pliable

A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the result of sudden impulse and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast

It is always thus impaled by a state of mind which is destined not to last that we make our irrevocable decisions

A power greater than any human being helped make this decision

He who reflects too much will achieve little

The opportunity is often lost by deliberating

The percentage of mistakes in quick decisions is no greater than in longdrawnout vacillations and the effect of decisiveness itself makes things go and creates confidence

Deliberation often loses a good chance

The mania of thinking renders one unfit for every activity

When possible make the decisions now even if action is in the future A revised decision usually is better than one reached at the last moment

We spend our days in deliberating and we end them without coming to any resolve

If you think too long you think wrong

You decide youll wait for your pitch Then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance And then you think about your swing And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch

The soul of dispatch is decision

The moment a question comes to your mind see yourself mentally taking hold of it and disposing of it In that moment you learn to become the decider and not the vacillator Thus you build character

So what do we do Anything Something So long as we just dont sit there If we screw it up start over Try something else If we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late

Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision

Some persons are very decisive when it comes to avoiding decisions

Do not wait for ideal circumstances nor the best opportunities they will never come

There comes a time when youve got to say Lets get off our asses and go I have always found that if I move with 75 percent or more of the facts I usually never regret it Its the guys who wait to have everything perfect that drive you crazy

Conditions are never just right People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing

Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard but takes the one before it and plays the game

He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses

If you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street

Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome

It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves

Alternatives and particularly desirable alternatives grow only on imaginary trees

The more one does and sees and feels the more one is able to do and the more genuine may be ones own appreciation of fundamental things like home and love and understanding companionship

Our danger is not too few but too many options to be puzzled by innumerable alternatives

The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvelously

I couldnt claim that I have never felt the urge to explore evil but when you descend into hell you have to be very careful

If decisions were a choice between alternatives decisions would come easy Decision is the selection and formulation of alternatives

You cannot have your cake and eat it

It is better to arm and strengthen your hero than to disarm and enfeeble your foe

You cannot sell the cow and sup the milk

There is only one answer to destructiveness and that is creativity

A door must either be shut or open

Heres a rule I recommend Never practice two vices at once

You cannot serve God and Mammon

Between two stools one sits on the ground

When you cannot make up your mind between two evenly balanced courses of action choose the bolder

When confronted with two courses of action I jot down on a piece of paper all the arguments in favor of each one then on the opposite side I write the arguments against each one Then by weighing the arguments pro and con and cancelling them out one against the other I take the course indicated by what remains

There are two ways of spreading light to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it

You cannot have it both ways

I would sort out all the arguments and see which belonged to fear and which to creativeness Other things being equal I would make the decision which had the larger number of creative reasons on its side

Of two evils choose the less

Of two evils choose the prettier

Where bads the best bad must be the choice

Both choices are painful but only one is therapeutic

God offers to every mind its choice between truth and repose Take which you pleaseyou can never have both

Necessity relieves us from the embarrassment of choice

When you have to make a choice and dont make it that is in itself a choice

A man without decision can never be said to belong to himself he is as a wave of the sea or a feather in the air which every breeze blows about

Nothing is so exhausting as indecision and nothing is so futile

Not to decide is to decide

Decision is a sharp knife that cuts clean and straight indecision a dull one that hacks and tears and leaves ragged edges behind it

There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision

In not making the decision youve made one Not doing something is the same as doing it

There is a time when we must firmly choose the course we will follow or the relentless drift of events will make the decision for us

You can only predict things after theyve happened

It is the mark of a good action that it appears inevitable in retrospect

No one knows what he can to do until he tries

Of all paths a man could strike into there is at any given moment a best path which here and now it were of all things wisest for him to do To find this path and walk in it is the one thing needful for him

Decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do

After a battle is over people talk a lot about how decisions were methodically reached but actually theres always a hell of a lot of groping around

No question is ever settled until it is settled right

No man who has not sat in the assemblies of men can know the light odd and uncertain ways in which decisions are often arrived at

No trumpets sound when the important decisions of our life are made Destiny is made known silently

A man must be able to cut a knot for everything cannot be untied

Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide And the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light

Necessity is not an established fact but an interpretation

We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny But what we put into it is ours

There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice because all you have staked will be lost if you look back Lifes point of no return

Optimism is an intellectual choice

The lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one the more active and swift the latter is the further he will go astray

Nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able to decide

There is one quality more important than knowhow This is knowhow by which we determine not only how to accomplish our purposes but what our purposes are to be

Destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved

What must be shall be and that which is a necessity to him that struggles is little more than choice to him that is willing

A wiser rule would be to make up your mind soberly what you want peace or war and then to get ready for what you want for what we prepare for is what we shall get

We have resolved to endure the unendurable and suffer what is insufferable

Once a decision was made I did not worry about it afterward

No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time

The last if not the greatest of the human freedoms to choose their own attitude in any given circumstance

He who has a choice has trouble

We have left undone those things which we ought to have done and we have done those things which we ought not to have done

Little deeds of kindness little words of love Make our earth an Eden like the heaven above

Whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well

Give me the ready hand rather than the ready tongue

Noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed

Heaven neer helps the man who will not help himself

Do not be afraid of defeat You are never so near to victory as when defeated in a good cause

To lose Is to learn

We have fought this fight as long and as well as we know how We have been defeated For us as a Christian people there is now but one course to pursue We must accept the situation

I let the American people down and I have to carry that burden for the rest of my life My political life is over I will never again have an opportunity to serve in any official position Maybe I can give a little advice from time to time

What is defeat Nothing but education nothing but the first step toward something better

Who apart From ourselves can see any difference between Our victories and our defeats

They were never defeated they were only killed

The mountain remains unmoved at seeming defeat by the mist

It is defeat that turns bone to flint it is defeat that turns gristle to muscle it is defeat that makes men invincible

What is defeat Nothing but education nothing but the first step to something better

Defeat should never be a source of discouragement but rather a fresh stimulus

Demagogues and agitators are very unpleasant but they are incidents to a free and constitutional country and you must put up with these inconveniences or do without many important advantages

In every age the vilest specimens of human nature are to be found among demagogues

Every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them

A wise fellow who is also worthless always charms the rabble

Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people

In a democracy the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional but must be maintained because it is indispensable

It has been said that Democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time

Democracy is based on the conviction that man has the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice

If you want to understand democracy spend less time in the library with Plato and more time in the buses with people

Democracy is a small hard core of common agreement surrounded by a rich variety of individual differences

People often say that in a democracy decisions are made by a majority of the people Of course that is not true Decisions are made by a majority of those who make themselves heard and who vote a very different thing

Democracy means government by the uneducated while aristocracy means government by the badly educated

My definition of a free society is a society where it is safe to be unpopular

It is the greatest good to the greatest number which is the measure of right and wrong

The greatest blessing of our democracy is freedom But in the last analysis our only freedom is the freedom to discipline ourselves

Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more than half of the time

The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal

What men value in the world is not rights but privileges

As I would not be a slave so I would not be a master This expresses my idea of democracy

Democracy is a festival of mediocrity

The job of a citizen is to keep his mouth open

It would be folly to argue that the people cannot make political mistakes They can and do make grave mistakes They know it they pay the penalty but compared with the mistakes which have been made by every kind of autocracy they are unimportant

Democracy is based upon the conviction that there are extraordinary possibilities in ordinary people

The world must be made safe for democracy

Democracy is the government of the people by the people for the people

Democracy means not I am as good as you are but You are as good as I am

All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy

I believe in Democracy because it releases the energies of every human being

While democracy must have its organization and controls its vital breath is individual liberty

People may live as much retired from the world as they please but sooner or later before they are aware they will find themselves debtor or creditor to somebody

He who imagines he can do without the world deceives himself much but he who fancies the world cannot do without him is still more mistaken

It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it

There are two tragedies in life One is not to get your hearts desire The other is to get it

Our desires always increase with our possessions The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us

He who desires naught will always be free

Ah love could you and I with Him conspire To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire Would not we shatter it to bits and then Remold it nearer to the hearts desire

Ail hope abandon ye who enter here

Despair is the conclusion of fools

Despair doubles our strength

It is the old practice of despots to use a part of the people to keep the rest in order

Despotism can no more exist in a nation until the liberty of the press be destroyed than the night can happen before the sun is set

I will believe in the right of one man to govern a nation despotically when I find a man born unto the world with boots and spurs and a nation with saddles on their backs

We are but as the instrument of Heaven Our work is not design but destiny

Every man meets his Waterloo at last

There is a divinity that shapes our ends Roughhew them how we will

Here is the devilandall to pay

Resist the Devil and he will flee from you

The devil was sick the devil a monk would be The devil was well the devil a monk was he

How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer son of the morning

Get thee behind me Satan

He will give the devil his due

The prince of darkness is a gentleman

The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose

Everyone gets their rough day No one gets a free ride Today so far I had a good day I got a dial tone

Thy fate is the common fate of all Into each life some rain must fall Some days must be dark and dreary

Some days you tame the tiger And some days the tiger has you for lunch

Some days the dragon wins

The one law that does not change is that everything changes and the hardship I was bearing today was only a breath away from the pleasures I would have tomorrow and those pleasures would be all the richer because of the memories of this I was enduring

Experience cold or heat pleasure or pain These experiences are fleeting they come and go Bear them patiently

To everything there is a season A time for every purpose under heaven A time to weep and a time to laugh A time to mourn and a time to dance

Let nothing disturb thee Let nothing affright thee All things are passing God changeth never

This too shall pass

The present will not long endure

We do not live an equal life but one of contrasts and patchwork now a little joy then a sorrow now a sin then a generous or brave action

I feel successful when the writing goes well This lasts five minutes Once when I was number one on the bestseller list I also felt successful That lasted three minutes

Sadness and gladness succeed each other

Sadness flies away on the wings of time

I dont think that one gets a flash of happiness once and never again it is there within you and it will come as certainly as death

Life comes in clusters clusters of solitude then clusters when there is hardly time to breathe

If winter comes can spring be far behind

Human misery must somewhere have a stop there is no wind that always blows a storm

No winter lasts forever no spring skips its turn

There are trees that seem to die at the end of autumn There are also the evergreens

Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection not in books alone but in every leaf in springtime

For lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth

If matters go badly now they will not always be so

Pain is never permanent

You will suffer and you will hurt You will have joy and you will have peace

Pain is part of being alive and we need to learn that Pain does not last forever nor is it necessarily unbearable and we need to be taught that

Pain is hard to bear But with patience day by day Even this shall pass away

Everything in life that we really accept undergoes a change So suffering must become love That is the mystery

Ive been failing for like ten or eleven years When it turns itll turn Right now Im just tryin to squeeze through a very tight financial period get the movie out and put my things in order

Ive never been poor only broke Being poor is a frame of mind Being broke is a temporary situation

In the darkest hour the soul is replenished and given strength to continue and endure

He that cant endure the bad will not live to see the good

Our toil is sweet with thankfulness Our burden is our boon The curse of earths gray morning is The blessing of its noon

Were it possible for us to see further than our knowledge reaches perhaps we would endure our sadnesses with greater confidence than our joys For they are moments when something new has entered into us something unknown

We may draw good outof evil we must not do evil that good may come

You will find a joy in overcoming obstacles

What we call the beginning is often an end And to make an end is to make a beginning The end is where we start from

When one door of happiness closes another opens but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us

Death is a door life opens

The world is round and the place which may seem like the end may also be only the beginning

Perhaps someday it will be pleasant to remember even this

One day in retrospect the years of struggle will strike you as the most beautiful

The crisis of today is the joke of tomorrow

Sadness flies away on the wings of time

Sometimes I found that in my happy moments I could not believe that I had ever been miserable

If our education had included training to bear unpleasantness and to let the first shock pass until we could think more calmly many an unbearable situation would become manageable and many a nervous illness avoided There is a proverb expressing this It says trouble is a tunnel through which we pass and not a brick wall against which we must break our head

Time in the turningover of days works change for better or worse

Experience is what really happens to you in the long run the truth that finally overtakes you

Time is like a river of fleeting events and its current is strong as soon as something comes into sight it is swept past us and something else takes its place and that too will be swept away

Time cools time clarifies no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours

Time bears away all things

Come what come may time and the hour runs through the roughest day

Time brings all things to pass

We undo ourselves by impatience Misfortunes have their life and their limits their sickness and their health

The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

Thats the advantage of having lived sixtyfive years You dont feel the need to be impatient any longer

Who longest waits most surely wins

Patience is a bitter plant but it has sweet fruit

No emergency excuses you from exercising tolerance

I believe the sign of maturity is accepting deferred gratification

He that can have patience can have what he will

Being human we should bear all we can

Adopt the pace of nature her secret is patience

You cant have genius without patience

The most potent and sacred command which can be laid upon any artist is the command wait

How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees

All things come round to him who will but wait

Panic is not an effective longterm organizing strategy

Selfdenial is painful for a moment but very agreeable in the end

And he shall reign a goodly king And sway his hand oer every clime With peace writ on his signet ring Who bides his time

It takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward of taking time to do anything well

Patience and fortitude conquer all things

Be not afraid of growing slowly be afraid only of standing still

Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast

No great thing is created suddenly any more than a bunch of grapes or a fig If you tell me that you desire a fig I answer you that there must be time Let it first blossom then bear fruit then ripen

Time deals gently only with those who take it gently

Hold on hold fast hold out Patience is genius

Genius is nothing but a greater aptitude for patience

All human wisdom is summed up in two words wait and hope

Genius is eternal patience

Serene I fold my hands and wait

The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong

Everything comes if a man will only wait

Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits

The secret of patience to do something else in the meantime

Have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew

Let us then be up and doing With a heart for any fate Still achieving still pursuing Learn to labor and to wait

God will wait as long as it takes for us

Waiting is not mere empty hoping It has the inner certainty of reaching the goal

All things come to him who waits provided he knows what he is waiting for

Hope and patience are two sovereign remedies for all the surest reposals the softest cushions to lean on in adversity

The strongest of all warriors are these twoTime and Patience

Who bides his time tastes the sweet Of honey in the saltiest tear And though he fares with slowest feet Joy runs to meet him drawing near

God grant us patience

Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit

There is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it

Patience is the best remedy for every trouble

For ye have need of patience

They are ill discoverers that think there is no land when they see nothing but sea

The best way out of a difficulty is through it

Many things difficult to design prove easy to performance

A diplomat is a man who remembers a ladys birthday but forgets her age

When a diplomat says yes he means perhaps when he says perhaps he means no when he says no he is no diplomat

I have discovered the art of deceiving diplomats I speak the truth and they never believe me

Diplomacy is to do and say The nastiest thing in the nicest way

Disappointment is the nurse of wisdom

The bestlaid schemes o mice an men Gang aft agley And leave us nought but grief and pain For promised joy

Disappointments are to the soul what a thunderstorm is to the air

Men would be angels Angels would be gods

Now is the Winter of our discontent

I was born to other things

Discontent is the first step in the progress of a man or a nation

Discretion in speech is more than eloquence

A sound discretion is not so much indicated by never making a mistake as by never repeating it

Great ability without discretion comes almost invariably to a tragic end

Let your own discretion be your tutor suit the action to the word the word to the action

The better part of valour is discretion

Disease is the retribution of outraged Nature

Disease is an experience of socalled mortal mind It is fear made manifest on the body

Desperate diseases require desperate remedies

Some remedies are worse than the disease

Whatever disgrace we may have deserved it is almost always in our power to reestablish our character

No one can disgrace us but ourselves

Doubt the man who swears to his devotion

Women distrust men too much in general and too little in particular

What loneliness is more lonely than distrust

Doctrine is nothing but the skin of truth set up and stuffed

How absurd to try to make two men think alike on matters of religion when I cannot make two timepieces agree

In religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed than for diose who deny the whole of it

You can and you cant You will and you wont Youll be damnd if you do Youll be damnd if you dont

Orthodoxy my Lord said Bishop Warburton in a whisper orthodoxy is my doxy heterodoxy is another mans doxy

Do not disturb the sleeping dog

Every dog is entitled to one bite

Who loves me will love my dog also

Youre only a dog old fellow a dog and youve had your day But never a friend of all my friends has been truer than you alway

I agree with Agassiz that dogs possess something very like a conscience

Oh the saddest of sights in a world of sin Is a little lost pup with his tail tucked in

Foxterriers are born with about four times as much original sin in them as other dogs

The more one comes to know men the more one comes to admire the dog

The dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table

The cowardly dog barks more violently than it bites

Every dog must have his day

Gentlemen of die Jury The one absolute unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world the one that never deserts him the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog

Galileo called doubt the father of invention it is certainly the pioneer

Of that there is no manner of doubt No probable possible shadow of doubt No possible doubt whatever

We know accurately only when we know little with knowledge doubt increases

When in doubt win the trick

I respect faith but doubt is what gets you an education

And he that doubteth is damned if he eat

To be or not to be that is the question Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles And by opposing end them

Our doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt

There lives more faith in honest doubt Believe me than in half the creeds

Im from Missouri you must show me

Unrest and uncertainty are our lot

Life is uncertain Eat dessert first

If we insist on being as sure as is conceivable we must be content to creep along the ground and can never soar

Nothing perhaps is strange once you have accepted life itself the great strange business which includes all lesser strangeness

The shortest period of time lies between the minute you put some money away for a rainy day and the unexpected arrival of rain

Our lives are never certain even for an hour

Throughout this life you can never be certain of living long enough to take another breath

I wanted a perfect ending Now Ive learned the hard way that some poems dont rhyme and some stories dont have a clear beginning middle and end Life is about not knowing having to change taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing whats going to happen next

Where will I be five years from now I delight in not knowing

The longing for certainty is in every human mind But certainty is generally illusion

No great deed is done by falterers who ask for certainty

Every year if not every day we have to wager our salvation upon some prophecy based upon imperfect knowledge

We are not certain we are never certain

We live in an epoch in which the solid ground of our preconceived ideas shakes daily under our certain feet

All business proceeds on beliefs or judgment of probabilities and not on certainties

The man who insists upon seeing with perfect clearness before he decides never decides

There is nothing certain in a mans life but that he must lose it

Ah what a dusty answer gets the soul when hot for certainties in this our life

When I was young I was sure of everything in a few years having been mistaken a thousand times I was not half so sure of most things as I was before at present I am hardly sure of anything but what God has revealed

We can be absolutely certain only about things we do not understand

You are all you will ever have for certain

Certitude is not the test of certainty We have been cocksure of many things that were not so

A reasonable probability is the only certainty

Doubt is not a pleasant state but certainty is a ridiculous one

Being unready and illequipped is what you have to expect in life It is the universal predicament It is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes Circumstances are seldom right You never have the capacities the strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have You must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen

To be absolutely certain about something one must know everything or nothing about it

Free man is by necessity insecure thinking man by necessity uncertain

We sail within a vast sphere ever drifting in uncertainty driven from end to end

Something must be left to chance nothing is sure in a sea fight

There is nothing certain about war except that one side wont win

There is only one thing about which I am certain and this is that there is very little about which one can be certain

The only certainty is that nothing is certain

Im often wrong but never in doubt

There is one thing certain namely that we can have nothing certain therefore it is not certain that we can have nothing certain

Every area of trouble gives out a ray of hope and the one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is certain or unchangeable

Any coward can fight a battle when hes sure of winning

The demand is for certainty is a sign of weakness

The unknown is what it is And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that Accept that its unknown and its plain sailing

Only a weak mind seeks ultimate answers

When nothing is sure everything is possible

He who forecasts all perils will never sail the sea

There is a time for departure even when theres no certain place to go

One doesnt discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of shore for a very long time

To teach how to live with uncertainty yet without being paralyzed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy can do

Faith acts promptly and boldly on the occasion on slender evidence

If we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late

The successful man is he who when he sees that no further certainty is attainable promptly decides on the most probable side as if he were completely sure it was right

Not seeing is halfbelieving

The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touchedthey must be felt with the heart

There is no advancement to him who stands trembling because he cannot see the end from the beginning

I am a woman who understands the necessity of an impulse whose goal or origin still lie beyond me

To end with certainty we must begin with doubting

Gardening is an exercise in optimism

In the face of uncertainty there is nothing wrong with hope

No object is mysterious The mystery is your eye

Faith hasnt got no eyes but shes longlegged

Maturity of mind is the capacity to endure uncertainty

Dont be afraid of the space between your dreams and reality If you can dream it you can make it so

If a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts but if he will content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties

I said heres the river I want to flow on heres the direction I want to go and put my boat in I was ready for the river to take unexpected turns and present obstacles

The future is no more uncertain than the present

Nobody can really guarantee the future The best we can do is size up the chances calculate the risks involved estimate our ability to deal with them and make our plans with confidence

Every time I think that Im getting old and gradually going to the grave something else happens

Many live in dread of what is coming Why should we The unknown puts adventure into life The unexpected around the corner gives a sense of anticipation and surprise Thank God for the unknown future

I think I look good out there Im strong powerful and artistic But I have my doubts as much as anyone

If I ever felt inclined to be timid as I was going into a room full of people I would say to myself Youre the cleverest member of one of the cleverest families in the cleverest class of the cleverest nation Why should you be frightened

Action will remove the doubts that theory cannot solve

To Death I yield but not to Doubt who slays before

Soon after a heartwrung decision something inevitably occurs to cast doubt on your choice Holding steady against that doubt usually proves your decision

Doubt breeds doubt

Its the moment you think you cant that you realize you can

From a shy timid girl I had become a woman of resolute character who could no longer be frightened by the struggle with troubles

Doubt is a pain too lonely to know that faith is his twin brother

Doubts and mistrust are the mere panic of timid imagination which the steadfast heart will conquer and the large mind transcend

Doubt indulged soon becomes doubt realized

When one devotes oneself to meditation mental burdens unnecessary worries and wandering thoughts drop off one by one life seems to run smoothly and pleasantly A student may now depend on intuition to make decisions As one acts on intuition second thought with its dualism doubt and hesitation does not arise

In doubt fear is the worst of prophets

The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today Let us move forward with strong and active faith

In case of doubt decide in favor of what is correct

Faith and doubt both are needed not as antagonists but working side by side to take us around the unknown curve

Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we often might win by fearing to attempt

A mans doubts and fears are his worst enemies

When in doubt do it

Yes I have doubted I have wandered off the path but I always return It is intuitive an intrinsic builtin sense of direction I seem always to find my way home

A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself

Doubt whom you will but never yourself

Self distrust is the cause of most of our failures In the assurance of strength there is strength and they are the weakest however strong who have no faith in themselves or their own powers

Doubt yourself and you doubt everything you see Judge yourself and you see judges everywhere But if you listen to the sound of your own voice you can rise above doubt and judgment And you can see forever

To be ambitious for wealth and yet always expecting to be poor to be always doubting your ability to get what you long for is like trying to reach east by traveling west There is no philosophy which will help a man to succeed when he is always doubting his ability to do so and thus attracting failure No matter how hard you work for success if your thought is saturated with the fear of failure it will kill your efforts neutralize your endeavors and make success impossible

Uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life Security is an insipid thing

I used to tremble from nerves so badly that the only way I could hold my head steady was to lower my chin practically to my chest and look up at Bogie That was the beginning of The Look

When nothing is sure everything is possible

Uncertainty and mystery are energies of life Dont let them scare you unduly for they keep boredom at bay and spark creativity

The quest for certainty blocks the search for meaning Uncertainty is the very condition to impel man to unfold his powers

All uncertainly is fruitful so long as it is accompanied by the wish to understand

Im delighted that the future is unsure Thats the way it should be

When we are not sure we are alive

Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst

The only thing that makes life possible is permanent intolerable uncertainty not knowing what comes next

In the face of uncertainty there is nothing wrong with hope

If there were dreams to sell Merry and sad to tell And the crier rung his bell What would you buy

I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side

Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace

For dhrames always go by conthraries my dear

We are such stuff As dreams are made on and our little life Is rounded with a sleep

Till the day when Ill be going down that Long long trail with you

When youre all dressed up and no place to go

If a woman were about to proceed to her execution she would demand a little time to perfect her toilet

Eat to please thyself but dress to please others

A torchlight procession marching down your throat

First you take a drink then the drink takes a drink then the drink takes you

For when the wine is in the wit is out

He neither drank smoked nor rode a bicycle Living frugally saving his money he died early surrounded by greedy relatives It was a great lesson to me

He who drinks a little too much drinks much too much

I am only a beer teetotaller not a champagne teetotaller

The worst thing about some men is that when they are not drunk they are sober

I have never been drunk but Ive often been overserved

In vino Veritas In wine there is truth

The morning cup of coffee has an exhilaration about it which the cheering influence of the afternoon or evening cup of tea cannot be expected to reproduce

They talk of my drinking but never my thirst

What when drunk one sees in other women one sees in Garbo sober

You are not drunk if you can lie on the floor without holding on

I like liquor its taste and its effects and that is just the reason why I never drink it

The Persians are very fond of wine It is also their general practice to deliberate upon affairs of weight when they are drunk and then in the morning when they are sober the decision to which they came the night before is put before them by the master of the house in which it was made and if it is then approved they act on it if not they set it aside Sometimes however they are sober at their first deliberations but in this case they always reconsider the matter under the influence of wine

Drunkenness is temporary suicide the happiness that it brings is merely negative a momentary cessation of unhappiness

Bacchus has drowned more men than Neptune

Temperance is the control of all the functions of our bodies The man who refuses liquor goes in for apple pie and develops a paunch is no ethical leader for me

Nothing ever tasted any better than a cold beer on a beautiful afternoon with nothing to look forward to but more of the same

Moderation is commonly firm and firmness is commonly successful

Abstinence is as easy for me as temperance would be difficult

I drink to make other people interesting

One of the disadvantages of wine is that is makes a man mistake words for thoughts

The innkeeper loves the drunkard but not for a soninlaw

Whisky drowns some troubles and floats a lot more

Malt does more than Milton can To justify Gods ways to man

A man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry

Drink not the third glass which thou canst not tame when once it is within thee

An Irish queer a fellow who prefers women to drink

Jellineks disease alcoholism is responsible for 50 percent of all auto fatalities 80 percent of all home violence 30 percent of all suicides 60 percent of all child abuse 65 percent of all drownings It is estimated that when a woman contracts the disease her husband leaves her in nine out often cases when a man contracts it his wife leaves in one out of ten cases

Eat bread at pleasure drink wine by measure

We frequently hear of people dying from too much drinking That this happens is a matter of record But the blame almost always is placed on whisky Why this should be I never could understand You can die from drinking too much of anything coffee water milk soft drinks and all such stuff as that And so long as the presence of death lurks with anyone who goes through the simple act of swallowing I will make mine whisky

Its a naive domestic burgundy without any breeding but I think youll be amused by its presumption

Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness

There are more old drunkards than old physicians

He is like many other geniuses a greater friend to the bottle than the bottle is to him

Boys should abstain from all use of wine until their eighteenth year for it is wrong to add fire to fire

I always keep a supply of stimulant handy in case I see a snake which I also keep handy

We had gone out there to pass the beautiful day of high summer like true Irishmen locked in the dark Snug of a public house

The whole world is about three drinks behind

Drunkenness is temporary suicide the happiness that it brings is merely negative a momentary cessation of unhappiness

There was an old hen And she had a wooden leg And every damned morning She laid another egg She was the best damned chicken On the whole damned farm And another little drink Wouldnt do us any harm

Its a long time between drinks

He is a drunkard who takes more than three glasses though he be not drunk

Drink today and drown all sorrow You shall perhaps not do it tomorrow

Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them

The habit of using ardent spirits by men in office has occasioned more injury to the public and more trouble to me than all other causes Were I to commence my administration again the first question I would ask respecting a candidate for office would be Does he use ardent spirits

I would appeal to Philip she said but to Philip sober

Drink for you know not whence you came nor why Drink for you know not why you go nor where

All excess is ill but drunkeness is of the worst sort It spoils health dismounts the mind and unmans men It reveals secrets is quarrelsome lascivious impudent dangerous and bad

There St John mingles with my friendly bowl The feat of reason and the flow of soul

Water is the only drink for a wise man

To do my duty in that state of life unto which it shall please God to call me

It is thy duty oftentimes to do what thou wouldst not thy duty too to leave undone that thou wouldst do

So nigh is grandeur to our dust So near is God to man When Duty whispers low Thou must The youth replies I can

No personal consideration should stand in the way of performing a public duty

Let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it

England expects every man to do his duty

Theirs not to make reply Theirs not to reason why Theirs but to do and die

Not once or twice in our rough island story The path of duty was the way to glory

Early to bed and early to rise Makes a man healthy wealthy and wise

Tomb thou shalt not hold Him longer Death is strong but Life is stronger Stronger than the dark the light Stronger than the wrong the right Faith and Hope triumphant say Christ will rise on Easter Day

Come ye saints look here and wonder See the place where Jesus lay He has borne our sins away Joyful tiding Yes the Lord has risen today

Some people make spectacles of themselves with a couple of glasses

Most people hate the taste of beer to begin with It is however a prejudice that many people have been able to overcome

Ive noticed the customers in health food stores They are pale skinny people who usually look half dead In a steak house you see robust ruddy people Theyre dying of course but they look terrific

Im a onedrink woman two at the most three Im under the table four Im under the host

Is life worth living That depends on the liver

Ive never been drunk but often Ive been overserved

Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow ye diet

Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are

Better halfe a loafe than no bread

The proof of the pudding is in the eating

Thou shouldst eat to live not live to eat

The nearer the bone the sweeter the meat

I want every peasant to have a chicken in his pot on Sundays

When I demanded of my friend what viands he preferred He quoth A large cold bottle and a small hot bird

Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die

For a man seldom thinks with more earnestness of anything than he does of his dinner

Man shall not live by bread alone

The way to a mans heart is through his stomach

Better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith

He hath eaten me out of house and home

They say fingers were made before forks and hands before knives

Bread is the staff of life

Buy not what you want but what you have need of what you do not want is dear at a farthing

He who will not economize will have to agonize

After order and liberty economy is one of the highest essentials of a free government Economy is always a guarantee of peace

Beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship

No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his outgoings

Have more than thou showest Speak less than thou knowest

A gentleman need not know Latin but he should at least have forgotten it

A onebook man is either a slow learner or an illequipped teacher

Arrogance pedantry and dogmatism are the occupational diseases of those who spend their lives directing the intellects of the young

Creatures whose main spring is curiosity will enjoy the accumulating of fact far more than the pausing at times to reflect on those facts

Good teaching is l4th preparation and 34ths theatre

He who would learn to fly one day must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance one cannot fly into flying

I believe we are solely responsible for our choices and we have to accept the consequences of every deed word and thought throughout our lifetime

A chief is a man who assumes responsibility He does not say My men were beaten he says I was beaten

The most considerable difference I note among men is not in their readiness to fall into error but in their readiness to acknowledge these inevitable lapses

It is very easy to forgive others their mistakes It takes more grit and gumption to forgive them for having witnessed your own

The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves

Theres folks ud stand on their heads and then say the fault was i their boots

Admitting error clears the score and proves you wiser than before

There is nothing wrong with making mistakes Just dont respond with encores

The road to wisdom Well its plain and simple to express Err and err and err again But less and less and less

I made a mistake today I made a mistake yesterday I think its very important to ignore the negative

The biggest quality in successful people I think is an impatience with negative thinking How many opportunities come along If you wait for the right one thats wrong because it may never be right and what have you got to lose Even if its a disaster youve tried youve learned something youve had an adventure And that doesnt mean you cant do it again

A peacefulness follows any decision even the wrong one

If you dont accept failure as a possibility you dont set high goals you dont branch out you dont try you dont take the risk

When we can begin to take our failures nonseriously it means we are ceasing to be afraid of them It is of immense importance to learn to laugh at ourselves

If I lose Ill walk away and never feel bad Because I did all I could there was nothing more to do

A man must learn to forgive himself

You must accept that you might fail then if you do your best and still dont win at least you can be satisfied that youve tried

Who would not rather trust and be deceived

Forget mistakes Forget failure Forget everything except what youre going to do now and do it Today is your lucky day

There is a way to look at the past Dont hide from it It will not catch you if you dont repeat it

Forget your mistakes but remember what they taught you

Supposing you have tried and failed again and again You may have a fresh start any moment you choose for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down

Failure is a disappointment but not defeat

Memories are the key not to the past but to the future

Failure is delay but not defeat It is a temporary detour not a deadend street

Finite to fail but infinite to venture

When in doubt make a fool of yourself There is a microscopically thin line between being brilliantly creative and acting like the most gigantic idiot on earth So what the hell leap

Failure really isnt terrible if you can say to yourself hey I know Im gonna be successful at what I want to do someday Failure doesnt become a big hangup then because its only temporary If failure is absolute then it would be a disaster but as long as its only temporary you can just go and achieve almost anything

Failure is an event never a person

It is better to be boldly decisive and risk being wrong than to agonize at length and be right too late

Ive never met a person I dont care what his condition in whom I could not see possibilities I dont care how much a man may consider himself a failure I believe in him for he can change the thing that is wrong in his life anytime he is prepared and ready to do it Whenever he develops the desire he can take away from his life the thing that is defeating it The capacity for reformation and change lies within

I think and think for months for years Ninetynine times the conclusion is false The hundredth time I am right

Take chances make mistakes Thats how you grow Pain nourishes your courage You have to fail in order to practice being brave

Take risks You cant fall off the bottom

When it goes wrong you feel like cutting your throat but you go on You dont let anything get you down so much that it beats you or stops you

If you judge people you have no time to love them

The mystery of love is greater than the mystery of death

Hatred paralyzes life love releases it Hatred confuses life love harmonizes it Hatred darkens life love illumines it

Whenever you are confronted with an opponent conquer him with love

Time is too slow for those who wait too swift for those who fear too long for those who grieve too short for those who rejoice but for those who love time is eternity

Nobody has ever measured not even poets how much the heart can hold

Tell me who admires and loves you and I will tell you who you are

I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for their religion I have shudderd at it I shudder no more I could be martyrd for my religion Love is my religion And I could die for that I could die for you

Bitterness imprisons life love releases it Bitterness paralyzes life love empowers it Bitterness sours life love sweetens it Bitterness sickens life love heals it Bitterness blinds life love anoints its eyes

No cord nor cable can so forcibly draw or hold so fast as love can do with a twined thread

I believe that life is given us so that we may grow in love and I believe that God is in me as the sun is in the color and fragrance of a flower

There is only one path to Heaven On Earth we call it Love

Love blinds us to faults hatred to virtues

Agape is disinterested love Agape does not begin by discriminating between worthy and unworthy people or any qualities people possess It begins by loving others for their sakes Therefore agape makes no distinction between friend and enemy it is directed toward both

We are obliged to love one another We are not strictly bound to like one another

To love ones neighbors to love ones enemies to love everything to love God in all His manifestations human love serves to love those dear to us but to love ones enemies we need divine love

Love is what we were borne with Fear is what we learned here

The higher animals are in a sense drawn into Man when he loves them and makes them as he does much more nearly human than they would otherwise be

He that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him

Beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God

That best portion of a good mans life His little nameless unremembered acts Of kindness and of love

A thing of beauty is a joy forever Its loveliness increases it will never Pass into nothingness

An outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace

Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen

Let us have faith that right makes might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it

After I am dead I would rather have men ask why Cato has no monument than why he had one

The greatest monarch on the proudest throne is obliged to sit upon his own arse

All celebrated people lose dignity on a close view

A celebrity is a person known for his wellknownness Celebrities intensify their celebrity images simply by being well known for relations among themselves By a kind of symbiosis celebrities live off each other

Before such a prodigious career judgement is torn between blame and admiration

Famous remarks are very seldom quoted correctly

It is strange how the memory of a man may float to posterity on what he would have himself regarded as the most trifling of his works

To be somebody you must last

The world like an accomplished hostess pays most attention to those whom it will soonest forget

Public opinion a vulgar impertinent anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for any one of us who is not content to be the average man

Mans attitude toward great qualities in others is often the same as toward high mountains he admires them but he prefers to walk around them

All the fame I look for in life is to have lived it quietly

A celebrity is one who is known to many persons he is glad he doesnt know

Fame is a bee It has a song It has a sting Ah too it has a wing

A sign of a celebrity is often that his name is worth more than his services

Martyrdom is the only way a man can become famous without ability

He that hath the name to be an early riser may sleep till noon

Some day each of us will be famous for fifteen minutes

I awoke one morning and found myself famous

To many fame comes too late

If you would not be forgotten as soon as you are dead either write things worth reading or do things worth writing

Men think highly of those who rise rapidly in the world whereas nothing rises quicker than dust straw and feathers

When family relations are no longer harmonious we have filial children and devoted parents

The family is the American fascism

The thing that impresses me most about North America is the way parents obey their children

Who of us is mature enough for offspring before the offspring themselves arrive The value of marriage is not that adults produce children but that children produce adults

Absence is one of the most useful ingredients of family life and to do it rightly is an art like any other

No matter how many communes anybody invents the family always creeps back

There are fathers who do not love their children there is no grandfather who does not adore his grandson

The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother

Today while the titular head of the family may still be the father everyone knows that he is little more than chairman at most of the entertainment committee

A mothers love for her child is like nothing else in the world It knows no aw no pity it dares all things and crushes down remorselessly all that stands in its path

Mother love has been much maligned An over mothered boy may go through life expecting each new woman to love him the way his mother did Her love may make any other love seem inadequate But an unloved boy would be even more likely to idealize love I dont think its possible for a mother or father to love a child too much

Unconditional love is loving your kids for who they are not for what they do it isnt something you will achieve every minute of every day But it is the thought we must hold in our hearts every day

The most important thing a father can do for his children is to love their mother

Where does the family start It starts with a young man falling in love with a girl no superior alternative has yet been found

Of course if you like your kids if you love them from the moment they begin you yourself begin all over again in them and with them

You can see them alongside the shuffleboard courts in Florida or on the porches of the old folks homes up north They are in love they have always been in love although sometimes they would have denied it And because they have been in love they have survived everything that life could throw at them even their own failures

In family life love is the oil that eases friction the cement that binds closer together and the music that brings harmony

Family love is messy clinging and of an annoying and repetitive pattern like bad wallpaper

In truth a family is what you make it It is made strong not by number of heads counted at the dinner table but by the rituals you help family members create by the memories you share by the commitment of time caring and love you show to one another and by the hopes for the future you have as individuals and as a unit

A mother discovers with great delight that one does not love ones children just because they are ones children but because of the friendship formed while raising them

The Family is the Country of the heart There is an angel in the Family who by the mysterious influence of grace of sweetness and of love renders the fulfillment of duties less wearisome sorrows less bitter The only pure joys unmixed with sadness

Smile at each other smile at your wife smile at your husband smile at your children smile at each other it doesnt matter who it is and that will help you to grow up in greater love for each other

No man has ever lived that had enough of childrens gratitude or womans love

I take my children everywhere but they always find their way back home

Happiness is having a large loving caring closeknit family in another city

The real question isnt whether or not you love your kids but how well you are able to demonstrate your love and caring so that your children really feel loved

The last step in parental love involves the release of the beloved the willing cutting of the cord that would otherwise keep the child in a state of emotional dependence

So if you have a grandma Thank the Good Lord up above And give Grandmama hugs and kisses For grandmothers are to love

Oh I love to see a man with a cigar It reminds me of my grandfather Morning to night he used to sit with a great big stogie dangling from his lips Oh the hours we kids used to spend sitting on his lap playing with the yellow whiskers beneath his nose Then hed take out his teeth with the cigar still in them and chase us around the room Wed all laugh and laugh then suddenly Grampas mood would change and wed all have to run for our lives You cant buy memories like that

Children begin by loving their parents After a time they judge them Rarely if ever do they forgive them

It is my pleasure that my children are free and happy and unrestrained by parental tyranny Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents

Perfect love sometimes does not come until the first grandchild

The reason grandparents and grandchildren get along so well is that they have a common enemy

The whole world is my family

To us family means putting your arms around each other and being there

The happiest moments of my life have been the few which I have passed at home in the bosom of my family

The family with an old person in it possesses a jewel

Babies are such a nice way to start people

Each time a new baby is born there is a possibility of reprieve Each child is a new being a potential prophet a new spiritual prince a new spark of light precipitated into the outer darkness

Bringing a child into the world is the greatest act of hope there is

Children are the worlds most valuable resource and its best hope for the future

Blessed be childhood which brings down something of heaven into the midst of our rough earthliness

Children are the bridge to heaven

We are given children to test us and make us more spiritual

One laugh of a child will make the holiest day more sacred still

Children are the true connoisseurs Whats precious to them has no price only value

There are no seven wonders of the world in the eyes of a child There are seven million

Children like animals use all their senses to discover the world Then artists come along and discover it the same way all over again

The only artists for whom I would make way are children For me the paintings of children belong side by side with the works of the masters

Why a fouryearold child could understand this report Run out and find me a fouryearold child

Adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up cause theyre looking for ideas

What do we teach our children We should say to each of them Do you know what you are You are a marvel You are unique You may become a Shakespeare a Michelangelo a Beethoven You have the capacity for anything

By giving children lots of affection you can help fill them with love and acceptance of themselves Then thats what they will have to give away

Teaching kids to count is fine but teaching them what counts is best

It is infinitely more useful for a child to hear a story told by a person than by computer Because the greatest part of the learning experience lies not in the particular words of the story but in the involvement with the individual reading it

The parents exist to teach the child but also they must learn what the child has to teach them and the child has a very great deal to teach them

Grown men can learn from very little children for the hearts of little children are pure Therefore the Great Spirit may show to them many things which older people miss

Children have a remarkable talent for not taking the adult world with the kind of respect we are so confident it ought to be given To the irritation of authority figures of all sorts children expend considerable energy in clowning around They refuse to appreciate the gravity of our monumental concerns while we forget that if we were to become more like children our concerns might not be so monumental

Youth I Stay close to the young and a little rubs off

Those who love the young best stay young longer

As long as I continue to hear normal people telling me I am too childish I know Im doing just fine

One of the most obvious facts about grownups to a child is that they have forgotten what it is like to be a child

All of us collect fortunes when we are children A fortune of colors of lights and darkness of movement of tensions Some of us have the fantastic chance to go back to his fortune when grown up

So like a forgotten fire a childhood can always flare up again within us

The great man is he that does not lose his childheart

What God is to the world parents are to their children

Honor your father and your mother

Honor your father and mother even as you honor God for all three were partners in your creation

When I was a boy of fourteen my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around But when I got to be twentyone I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years

Remember no matter how many candles you blow out this year theres one gal who will always think of you as young strong and handsome your mother

Theres no way to be a perfect mother and a million ways to be a good one

God could not be everywhere therefore he made mothers

Parents are often so busy with the physical rearing of children that they miss the glory of parenthood just as the grandeur of the trees is lost when raking leaves

The best inheritance a parent can give his children is a few minutes of his time each day

If I had known how wonderful it would be to have grandchildren Id have had them first

Few things are more delightful than grandchildren fighting over your lap

The greatest sweetener of human life is Friendship

A friend might well be reckoned the masterpiece of nature

Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy much the greatest is the possession of friendship

Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together

The glory of friendship is not the outstretched hand nor the kindly smile nor the joy of companionship it is the spiritual inspiration that comes to one when he discovers that someone else believes in him and is willing to trust him

What a great blessing is a friend with a heart so trusty you may safely bury all your secrets in it

When a friend is in trouble dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do Think up something appropriate and do it

A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out

The most I can do for my friend is simply to be his friend

Friendship improves happiness and abates misery by doubling our joy and dividing our grief

It is not what you give your friend but what you are willing to give him that determines the quality of your friendship

A friend is someone who knows all about you and loves you just the same

It is not the talking that counts between friends it is the never needing to say what counts

True friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable

Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies

To be a good friend remember that we are human magnets that like attracts like and that as we give we get

Treat your friends as you do your pictures and place them in their best light

Friendships are fragile things and require as much care in handling as any other fragile and precious thing

Every man should have a fairsized cemetery in which to bury the faults of his friends

Since there is nothing so well worth having as friends never lose a chance to make them

You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you

The only way to have a friend is to be one

Friends will not only live in harmony but in melody

It is great to have friends when one is young but indeed it is still more so when you are getting old When we are young friends are like everything else a matter of course In the old days we know what it means to have them

Old friends are best King James used to call for his old shoes they were the easiest for his feet

My father told me marijuana would cause me brain damage because if he caught me doing it he was going to break my head

Were supposed to take our problems to a family adviser Personally Ive never met a family adviser Theyre all off somewhere listening to dirty stories

It takes about five years for a walnut tree to produce nuts but this is not true of a family tree

My father never raised his hand to any one of his children except in selfdefense

To encourage my little kid to eat Id sometimes say Just pretend its sand

Sis Ive been wondering On my birthday mom always gives me five thousand dollars How much does she give you

My kid asked if he could borrow ten dollars When I only gave him five dollars he said Okay since you owe me the other five dollars well call it even

Never raise your hands to your kids It leaves your groin unprotected

Never lend your car to someone youve given birth to

There is little less trouble in governing a private family than a whole kingdom

None but a mule denies his family

Fare thee well and if for ever Still for ever fare thee well

Sweets to the sweet farewell

A farmer is always going to be rich next year

Farming is a most senseless pursuit a mere laboring in a circle You sow that you may reap and then you reap that you may sow Nothing ever comes of it

Some people tell us that there aint no Hell But they never farmed so how can they tell

Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God if He ever had a chosen people whose breasts He has made His peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue

The farmer works the soil The agriculturist works the farmer

Let us never forget that the cultivation of the earth is the most important labor of man When tillage begins other arts follow The farmers therefore are the founders of civilization

A love of fashion makes the economy go round

A pious man is one who would be an atheist if the king were

Every generation laughs at the old fashions but religiously follows the new

Nothing is so hideous as an obsolete fashion

The tradition of the new Yesterdays avantgardexperiment is todays chic and tomorrows cliche

Art produces ugly things which frequently become beautiful with time Fashion on the other hand produces beautiful things which always become ugly with time

Be not the first by whom the new are tried Nor yet the last to lay the old aside

Fashion can be bought Style one must possess

Fashion which elevates the bad to the level of the good subsequently turns its back on bad and good alike

Even knowledge has to be in fashion and where it is not it is wise to affect ignorance

The fashion wears out more apparel than the man

Fashions after all are only induced epidemics

When a man is once in fashion all he does is right

I have heard with admiring submission the experience of the lady who declared that the sense of being welldressed gives a feeling of inward tranquility which religion is powerless to bestow

Fashion condemns us to many follies the greatest is to make oneself its slave

Conformism is so hot on the heels of the massproduced avantgarde that the ins and the outs change places with the speed of mach 3

There goes a man made by the Lord Almighty and not by his tailor

Fashions fade style is eternal

And by my grave youd pray to have me back So I could see how well you look in black

A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress

A fashionable woman is always in love with herself

I see that the fashion wears out more apparel than the man

Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months

Certainty generally is illusion and repose is not the destiny of man

How many roads must a man walk down Before you call him a man

Heaven is the place where the donkey finally catches up with his carrot hell is the eternity while he waits for it

Continuous effort not strength or intelligence is the key to unlocking our potential

That that is is

Everything passes everything wears out everything breaksTout passe tout lasse tout casse

Whatsoer we perpetrate We do but row we are steered by fate

Whatever limits us we call Fate

Whatever the universal nature assigns to any man at any time is for the good of that man at that time

Certain signs precede certain events

See how the Fates their gifts allot For A is happy B is not Yet B is worthy I dare say Of more prosperity than A

Destiny n a tyrants authority for crime and a fools excuse for failure

Fate rules the affairs of mankind with no recognizable order

He who does not desire or fear the uncertain day or capricious fate is equal to the gods above and loftier than mortals

The worst is not always certain but its very likely

It is a long road from conception to completion

God keeps the wicked to give them time to repent

Fortune is fickle and soon asks back what he has given

Destiny is what you are supposed to do in life Fate is what kicks you in the ass to make you do it

That which God writes on thy forehead thou wilt come to it

When its time has come the prey goes to the hunter

The bow is bent the arrow flies The winged shaft of fate

He has gone to the demnition bowwows

Tis Fate that flings the dice And as she flings Of kings makes peasants And of peasants kings

Thou must in commanding and winning or serving and losing suffering or triumphing be either anvil or hammer

We make our fortunes and we call them fate

Though men determine the gods do dispose and oft times many things fall out between the cup and the lip

The Moving Finger writes and having writ Moves on nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it

The die is cast

The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge

Call no man your father upon the earth for one is your Father which is in heaven

It is a wise father that knows his own child

A father is a banker provided by nature

The child is father of the man

There is so much good in the worst of us And so much bad in the best of us That it ill behooves any of us To find fault with the rest of us

The greatest of faults I should say is to be conscious of none

The defects of great men are the consolation of the dunces

We keep on deceiving ourselves in regard to our faults until we at last come to look upon them as virtues

A fanatic is a man who consciously overcompensates a secret doubt

Fear is the parent of cruelty

We must travel in the direction of our fear

Once men are caught up in an event they cease to be afraid Only the unknown frightens men

People wish to learn to swim and at the same time to keep one foot on the ground

Fear is not an unknown emotion to us

So let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance

I will show you fear in a handful of dust

Fear of losing is what makes competitors so great Show me a gracious loser and Ill show you a perennial loser

Nothing in life is to be feared It is only to be understood

Nothing is more despicable than respect based on fear

Just as courage imperils life fear protects it

Fear comes from uncertainty When we are absolutely certain whether of our worth or worthlessness we are almost impervious to fear Thus a feeling of utter unworthiness can be a source of courage

Where no hope is left is left no fear

The human race is a race of cowards and I am not only marching in that procession but carrying a banner

Men hesitate less to injure a man who makes himself loved than to injure one who makes himself feared for their love is held by a chain of obligation which because of mens wickedness is broken on every occasion for the sake of selfish profit but their fear is secured by a dread of punishment

I a stranger and afraid In a world I never made

Fear has a smell as Love does

Fear can be headier than whisky once man has acquired a taste for it

The suspense is terrible I hope it will last

A good scare is worth more to a man than good advice

How does one kill fear I wonder How do you shoot a spectre through the heart slash off its spectral head take it by the spectral throat

In grief we know the worst of what we feel But who can tell the end of what we fear

The only way to get rid of my fears is to make films about them

I would often be a coward but for the shame of it

Horror is a feeling that cannot last long human nature is incapable of supporting it

The horse does abominate the camel the mighty elephant is afraid of a mouse and they say that the lion which scorneth to turn his back upon the stoutest animal will tremble at the crowing of a cock

The flocks fear the wolf the crops the storm and the trees the wind

We all choke and the man who says he doesnt choke is lying like hell

A man who says he has never been scared is either lying or else hes never been any place or done anything

All men are afraid in battle The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty Duty is the essence of manhood

Only the selfdeceived will claim perfect freedom from fear

Every day I wake up a little afraid Only a fool is never afraid

This is the century of fear

There is perhaps nothing so bad and so dangerous in life as fear

The trouble with most people is that they think with their hopes or fears or wishes rather than with their minds

Fear true fear is a savage frenzy Of all the insanities of which we are capable it is surely the most cruel

Fear is the fire that melts Icarian wings

There seemed to be endless obstaclesit seemed that the root cause of them all was fear

How very little can be done under the spirit of fear

The most destructive element in the human mind is fear Fear creates aggressiveness aggressiveness engenders hostility hostility engenders feara disastrous circle

A mans doubts and fears are his worst enemies

Great selfdestruction follows upon unfounded fear

Fear is the most devastating of all human emotions Man has no trouble like the paralyzing effects of fear

Only when we are no longer afraid do we begin to live

Neither a man nor a crowd nor a nation can be trusted to act humanely or to think sanely under the influence of a great fear

The worst sorrows in life are not in its losses and misfortunes but its fears

No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as fear

The thing I fear most is fear

Nothing is so much to be feared as fear

Nothing is terrible except fear itself

The only thing we have to fear is fear itselfnameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance

It is better by noble boldness to run the risk of being subject to half the evils we anticipate than to remain in cowardly listlessness for fear of what might happen

There is no devil but fear

Men who look young act young and everlastingly harp on the fact that they are youngbut who nevertheless think and act with a degree of caution what would be excessive in their grandfathersare the curses of the world

Theres nothing Im afraid of like scared people

God Is there anything uglier than a frightened man

The only thing I am afraid of is fear

Of all the passions fear weakens judgment most

All forms of fear produce fatigue

The more I traveled the more I realized that fear makes strangers of people who should be friends

Power does not corrupt Fear corrupts perhaps the fear of a loss of power

When men are ruled by fear they strive to prevent the very changes that will abate it

Fear if allowed free rein would reduce all of us to trembling shadows of men for whom only death could bring release

If we let things terrify us life will not be worth living

When fear is excessive it can make many a man despair

Fear makes the wolf bigger than he is

One of the effects of fear is to disturb the senses and cause things to appear other than what they are

What begins in fear usually ends in folly

In doubt fear is the worst of prophets

Fear is the most damnable damaging thing to human personality in the whole world

Fear is the main source of superstition and one of the main sources of cruelty

Fear is like fire If controlled it will help you if uncontrolled it will rise up and destroy you Mens actions depend to a great extent upon fear We do things either because we enjoy doing them or because we are afraid not to do them

To hate and to fear is to be psychologically ill it is in fact the consuming illness of our time

Fear is an acid which is pumped into ones atmosphere It causes mental moral and spiritual asphyxiation and sometimes death death to energy and all growth

Fear is the proof of a degenerate mind

Fear is an insidious virus Given a breeding place in our minds it will eat away our spirit and block the forward path of our endeavors

A man who is afraid will do anything

Excessive fear is always powerless

Fear makes strangers of people who should be friends

O how vain and vile a passion is this fear What base uncomely things it makes men do

The unknown is what it is And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams illusions wars peace love hate all that Unknown is what it is Accept that its unknown and its plain sailing

No passion so effectively robs the mind of its powers of acting and reasoning as fear

As many people die from an excess of timidity as from bravery

If a man harbors any sort of fear it percolates through all his thinking damages his personality makes him landlord to a ghost

If you let fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct then your life will be safe expedient and thin

There is nothing that fear or hope does not make men believe

Fear is the prison of the heart

I have come to realize that all my trouble with living has come from fear and smallness within me

He who fears something gives it power over him

How very little can be done under the spirit of fear

All fear is bondage

We promise according to our hopes and perform according to our fears

There seemed to be endless obstacles it seemed that the root cause of them all was fear

No power is strong enough to be lasting if it labors under the weight of fear

Where fear is happiness is not

Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness

Were frightened of what makes us different

Fear always springs from ignorance

We are always afraid to start something that we want to make very good true and serious

The cravens fear is but selfishness like his merriment

When did reason ever direct our desires or our fears

Fear is created not by the world around us but in the mind by what we think is going to happen

Fear is secured by a dread of punishment

We are largely the playthings of our fears To one fear of the dark to another of physical pain to a third of public ridicule to a fourth of poverty to a fifth of loneliness for all of us our particular creature waits in ambush

If your desires be endless your cares and fears will be so too

We fear the thing we want the most

We are more often frightened than hurt and we suffer more from imagination than from reality

Fear born of that stern matron Responsibility

Only your mind can produce fear

Fear follows crime and is its punishment

All infractions of love and equity in our social relations are punished by fear

The only thing we have to fear on this planet is man

There is nothing in the universe that I fear but that I shall not know all my duty or fail to do it

I can stand what I know Its what I dont know that frightens me

I am never afraid of what I know

Fear comes from uncertainty When we are absolutely certain whether of our worth or worthlessness we are almost impervious to fear

Let us not fear the hidden Or each other

We all fear what we dont knowits natural

Fear always springs from ignorance

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge

Why should we break up Our snug and pleasant party Time was made for slaves But never for us so hearty

Let us have wine and woman mirth and laughter Sermons and sodawater the day after

The feast of reason and the flow of soul

Feast and your halls are crowded Fast and the world goes by

Your own property is concerned when your neighbors house is on fire

The burnt child dreads the fire

There can no great smoke arise but there must be some fire

AH the fats in the fire

As lacking in privacy as a goldfish

She is neither fish nor flesh nor good red herring

Master I marvel how the fishes live in the sea Why as men do aland the great ones eat up the little ones

We have here other fish to fry

There are as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it

To fish in troubled waters

You must lose a fly to catch a trout

A fishingrod was a stick with a hook at one end and a fool at the other

Angling may be said to be so like the mathematics that it can never be fully learnt

God never did make a more calm quiet innocent recreation than angling

Angling is an innocent cruelty

If any one attempts to haul down the American flag shoot him on the spot

When Freedom from her mountain height Unfurled her standard to the air She tore the azure robe of night And set the stars of glory there

Cheers for the sailors that fought on the wave for it Cheers for the soldiers that always were brave for it Tears for the men that went down to the grave for it Here comes the Flag

The flag of our Union forever

Oh say does that starspangled banner yet wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave

Yes well rally round the flag boys well rally once again Shouting the battlecry of Freedom We will rally from the hillside well gather from the plain Shouting the battlecry of Freedom

Your flag and my flag And how it flies today In your land and my land And half a world away Rosered and bloodreed The stripes forever gleam Snowwhite and soulwhite The good forefathers dream Skyblue and trueblue with stars to gleam aright The gloried guidon of the day a shelter through the night

Shoot if you must this old gray head But spare your countrys flag she said

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

Men are like stone jugs you may lug them where you like by the ears

A man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net for his feet

O that mens ears should be To counsel deaf but not to flattery

Their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue

It is easy to flatter it is harder to praise

Flirtation attention without intention

Men seldom make passes At girls who wear glasses

It is the same in love as in war a fortress that parleys is half taken

Flowers may beckon towards us but they speak toward heaven and God

Flowers are words Which even a babe may understand

But neer the rose without the thorn

And I will make thee beds of roses And a thousand fragrant posies

Consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin

Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose

In Flanders fields the poppies blow Between the crosses row on row That mark our place and in the sky The larks still bravely singing fly Scarce heard among the guns below

Tis the last rose of summer Left blooming alone

Where flowers degenerate man cannot live

Of what are you afraid my child inquired the kindly teacher Oh sir the flowers they are wild replied the timid creature

If of thy mortal goods thoU art bereft And from thy slender store two loaves alone to thee are left Sell one and with the dole Buy hyacinths to feed thy soul

Say it with flowers

I sometimes think that never blows so red The Rose as where some buried Caesar bled That every Hyacinth the Garden wears Dropt in her Lap from some once lovely Head

One thing is certain and the rest is lies The Flower that once has blown for ever dies

When lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd And the great star early droopd in the western sky the night I mournd and yet shall mourn with everreturning spring

It is easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar

A fly sat on the chariot wheel And said What a dust I raise

Baby bye Heres a fly Let us watch him you and I How he crawls Up the walls Yet he never falls

The folly of one man is the fortune of another

He who lives without committing any folly is not so wise as he thinks

Answer a fool according to his folly

To swallow gudgeons ere theyre catchd And count their chickens ere theyre hatchd

To stumble twice against the same stone is a proverbial disgrace

At the end of every diet the path curves back toward the trough

Food is an important part of a balanced diet

Its a very odd thing As odd as can be That whatever Miss T eats Turns into Miss T

Never eat more than you can lift

There is no love sincerer than the love of food

Kissing dont last cookery do

Hunger is not debatable

To eat well in England you should have breakfast three times a day

To get the best results you must talk to your vegetables

Toots Shores restaurant is so crowded nobody goes there anymore

Dinner a time when one should eat wisely but not too well and talk well but not too wisely

There is no such thing as a little garlic

Even were a cook to cook a fly he would keep the breast for himself

No man is lonely while eating spaghetti it requires so much attention

A hungry man is not a free man

A great step toward independence is a goodhumoured stomach

I feel a recipe is only a theme which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation

All happiness depends on a leisurely breakfast

Cheese milks leap toward immortality

A gourmet is just a glutton with brains

Vegetarianism is harmless enough though it is apt to fill a man with wind and selfrighteousness

If you wish to grow thinner diminish your dinner

To a man with an empty stomach food is god

Hunger is the best sauce

A man is in general better pleased when he has a good dinner upon his table than when his wife talks Greek

If you ask the hungry man how much is two and two he replies four loaves

A good meal makes a man feel more charitable toward the whole world than any sermon

More die in the United States of too much food than of too little

A good meal ought to begin with hunger

It is a hard matter my fellow citizens to argue with the belly since it has no ears

The one way to get thin is to reestablish a purpose in life

A smiling face is half the meal

There is no such thing as a pretty good omelette

Fish to taste right must swim three times in water in butter and in wine

A fools head never whitens

For ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise

Many have been the wise speeches of fools though not so many as the foolish speeches of wise men

Men trip not on mountains they stumble on stones

There are bearded fools

Every man is a damn fool for at least five minutes every day wisdom consists in not exceeding the limit

Nothing is more like a wise man than a fool who holds his tongue

If fifty million people say a foolish thing it is still a foolish thing

There are two kinds of fools one says This is old therefore it is good the other says This is new therefore it is better

A fool must now and then be right by chance

Let us be thankful for the fools But for them the rest of us could not succeed

Here cometh April again and as far as I can see the world hath more fools in it than ever

A busy fool is fitter to be shut up than a downright madman

With stupidity the gods themselves struggle in vain

There are some people that if they dont know you cant tell em

A fellow who is always declaring hes no fool usually has his suspicions

Stupidity is an elemental force for which no earthquake is a match

Every inch that is not fool is rogue

A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men

He who lives without folly is not as wise as he thinks

The poor schlemiel is a man who falls on his back and breaks his nose

None but a fool worries about things he cannot influence

Nature never makes any blunders when she makes a fool she means it

Set a beggar on horseback and he will ride a gallop

It is said that a wise man who stands firm is a statesman and a foolish man who stands firm is a catastrophe

It is hard to free fools from the chains they revere

Haint we got all the fools in town on our side And aint that a big enough majority for any town

For Gods sake give me the young man who has brains enough to make a fool of himself

Who loves not women wine and song Remains a fool his whole life long

What is life but a series of inspired follies The difficulty is to find them to do

There is no chance for old fools

A fool always finds one still more foolish to admire him

You men think old men are fools but old men know young men are the fools

Haint we got all the fools in town on our side And aint that a big enough majority in any town

A fool and his money are soon parted

The fool hath said in his heart There is no God

A learned fool is more foolish than an ignorant fool

For fools rush in where angels fear to tread

Even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise

The right to be a cussed fool Is safe from all devices human Its common ez a ginI rule To every critter born of woman

It is in the half fools and the half wise that the greatest danger lies

If you wish to avoid seeing a fool you must first break your lookingglass

The fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool

A fools bolt is soon shot

Lord what fools these mortals be

He who thinks himself wise O heavens is a great fool

The power that is supported by force alone will have cause often to tremble

Force is allconquering but its victories are shortlived

Force and not opinion is the queen of the world but it is opinion that uses the force

In life as in chess forethought wins

If a man take no thought about what is distant he will find sorrow near at hand

Forethought we may have undoubtedly but not foresight

Look ere thou leap see ere thou go

I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind I am like a broken vessel

And when he is out of sight quickly also he is out of mind

The world forgetting by the world forgot

There is no remembrance which time does not obliterate nor pain which death does not terminate

If I forget thee O Jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning

Who is the Forgotten Man He is the clean quiet virtuous domestic citizen who pays his debts and his taxes and is never heard of out of his little circle

How we remember what we remember and why we remember form the most personal map of our individuality

Reconciliation is more beautiful than victory

The stupid neither forgive nor forget the naive forgive and forget the wise forgive but do not forget

Forgetting is the cost of living cheerfully

Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom

I can forgive but I cannot forget is only another way of saying I will not forgive Forgiveness ought to be like a canceled notetorn in two and burned up so that it never can be shown against one

Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrong

Anger repressed can poison a relationship as surely as the crudest words

Forgiveness means letting go of the past

I know now that patriotism is not enough I must have no hatred and bitterness toward anyone

Stretch out your hand Let no human soul wait for a benediction

Nobody ever forgets where he buried a hatchet

Anger as soon as fed is dead tis starving makes it fat

Once a woman has forgiven a man she must not reheat his sins for breakfast

Theres no point in burying a hatchet if youre going to put up a marker on the site

As long as you dont forgive who and whatever it is will occupy a rentfree space in your mind

Courage and clemency are equal virtues

One may have been a fool but theres no foolishness like being bitter

Not the power to remember but its very opposite the power to forget is a necessary condition for our existence

Once a woman has forgiven a man she must not reheat his sins for breakfast

Keeping score of old scores and scars getting even and oneupping always make you less than you are

Forgiveness is allpowerful Forgiveness heals all ills

The forgiving state of mind is a magnetic power for attracting good

Forgiveness is an act of the will and the will can function regardless of the temperature of the heart

To be wronged is nothing unless you continue to remember it

Who understands much forgives much

Forgiveness is the act of admitting we are like other people

Grace fills empty spaces but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it and it is grace itself which makes this void

Know all and you will pardon all

People are more than the worst thing they have ever done in their lives

The secret of forgiving everything is to understand nothing

Speak not against anyone whose burden you have not weighed yourself

Nothings easier than believing we understand experiences weve never had

The heart has always the pardoning power

To understand is to forgive even oneself

To what extent is any given man morally responsible for any given act We do not know

The weak can never forgive Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong

Only the brave know how to forgive A coward never forgave it is not in his nature

Any man can seek revenge it takes a king or prince to grant a pardon

To be angry about trifles is mean and childish to rage and be furious is brutish and to maintain perpetual wrath is akin to the practice and temper of devils but to prevent and suppress rising resentment is wise and glorious is manly and divine

Hatred is a death wish for the hated not a life wish for anything else

Hatred is a passion requiring one hundred times the energy of love Keep it for a cause not an individual Keep it for intolerance injustice stupidity For hatred is the strength of the sensitive Its power and its greatness depend on the selflessness of its use

Resentment is the number one offender It destroys more alcoholics than anything else From it stem all forms of spiritual disease for we have been not only mentally and physically ill we have been spiritually sick

To oppose something is to maintain it

Dwelling on the negative simply contributes to its power

To carry a grudge is like being stung to death by one bee

Resentments are burdens we dont need to carry

The enslaver is enslaved the hater harmed

By putting his hand around my neck he slowly strangled himself

The one who deals the mortal blow receives the mortal wound

Without forgiveness life is governed by an endless cycle of resentment and retaliation

Malice drinks onehalf of its own poison

I tell you there is no such thing as creative hate

Reject hatred without hating

Hate would destroy him who hated

In hatred as in love we grow like the thing we brood upon What we loathe we graft into our very soul

Resentment is weak and lowers your selfesteem

Hate is a prolonged form of suicide

Hatred is like fireit makes even light rubbish deadly

You cannot shake hands with a clenched fist

Hate is all a lie there is no truth in hate

Hate is not a good counselor

Bitterness imprisons life love releases it

If the will remains in protest it stays dependent on that which it is protesting against

Hate smolders and eventually destroys not the hated but the hater

It is almost impossible to throw dirt on someone without getting a little on yourself

If you hate a person you hate something in him that is part of yourself

Fire destroys that which feeds it

You cannot hate other people without hating yourself

Whom they have injured they also hate

Rage and bitterness do not foster femininity They harden the heart and make the body sick

I used to store my anger and it affected my play Now I get it out Im never rude to my playing partner Im very focused on the ball Then its over

Anger is a short madness

My mother used to say He who angers you conquers you

The angry people are those people who are most afraid

Anger as soon as fed is dead tis starving makes it fat

Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools

Anger and worry are the enemies of clear thought

Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else you are the one who gets burned

Anger is a killing thing it kills the man who angers for each rage leaves him less than he had been beforeit takes something from him

Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time as aromatic wine it seemed on swallowing warm and racy its afterflavor metallic and corroding gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned

Revenge could steal a mans life until there was nothing left but emptiness

Revenge may not be a particularly high consciousnessoriented activity

The human heart in its perversity finds it hard to escape hatred and revenge

A man can lose sight of everything else when hes bent on revenge and it aint worth it

The whole human race loses by every act of personal vengeance

Forgiveness is the sweetest revenge

One forgives to the degree that one loves

One is as one is and the love that cant encompass both is a poor sort of love

Forgiveness is the final form of love

The days are too short even for love how can there be enough time for quarreling

Forgiveness is the most tender part of love

The best proof of love is trust

Love is an act of endless forgiveness a tender look which becomes a habit

We are told that people stay in love because of chemistry or because they remain intrigued with each other because of many kindnesses because of luck But part of it has got to be forgiveness and gratefulness

For me its not possible to forget and I dont understand people who when the love is ended can bury the other person in hatred or oblivion For me a man I have loved becomes a kind of brother

Today I forgive all those who have ever offended me I give my love to all thirsty hearts both to those who love me and to those who do not love me

Experience is how life catches up with us and teaches us to love and forgive each other

We never ask God to forgive anybody except when we havent

Forgiveness is Gods command

God will forgive me that is His business

God will forgive me the foolish remarks I have made about Him just as I will forgive my opponents the foolish things they have written about me even though they are spiritually as inferior to me as I to thee O God

Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you

I have looked on a lot of women with lust Ive committed adultery in my heart many times God recognizes I will do this and forgives me

How Forgiveness Helps Us Forgiveness is the answer to the childs dream of a miracle by which what is broken is made whole again what is soiled is again made clean

Forgiveness is allpowerful Forgiveness heals all ills

Those who are free of resentful thoughts surely find peace

I can have peace of mind only when I forgive rather than judge

The forgiving state of mind is a magnetic power for attracting good

Judge not that ye be not judged

It is in pardoning that we are pardoned

Forgiving those who hurt us is the key to personal peace

Forgive all who have offended you not for them but for yourself

To forgive is the highest most beautiful form of love In return you will receive untold peace and happiness

Forgiveness is the key to action and freedom

Forgiveness is the way to true health and happiness

Humanity is never so beautiful as when praying for forgiveness or else forgiving another

Those who cant forget are worse off than those who cant remember

Forgiveness is the remission of sins For it is by this that what has been lost and was found is saved from being lost again

I can pardon everybodys mistakes except my own

If you havent forgiven yourself something how can you forgive others

The moment an individual can accept and forgive himself even a little is the moment in which he becomes to some degree lovable

They may not deserve forgiveness but I do

I forgive myself for having believed for so long that I was never good enough to have get be what I wanted

How unhappy is he who cannot forgive himself

I learned that true forgiveness includes total selfacceptance And out of acceptance wounds are healed and happiness is possible again

Every man treats himself as society treats the criminal

To understand is to forgive even oneself

Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors

He that cannot forgive others breaks the bridge over which he must pass himself for every man has need to be forgiven

Always forgive your enemies nothing annoys them so much

Forgiveness is the noblest vengeance

There is no revenge so complete as forgiveness

Many promising reconciliations have broken down because while both parties came prepared to forgive neither party came prepared to be forgiven

Forgiveness is mans deepest need and highest achievement

Abandon your animosities and make your sons Americans

Her breasts and arms ached with the beauty of her own forgiveness

Life is an adventure in forgiveness

The cut worm forgives the plow

Forgiveness is the highest and most difficult of all moral lessons

The fragrance of the violet sheds on the heel that has crushed it

How shall I love the sin yet keep the sense And love the offender yet detest the offence

Forgiveness is the giving and so the receiving of life

Who would care to question the ground of forgiveness or compassion

O friends I pray tonight Keep not your kisses for my dead cold brow The way is lonely let me feel them now Think gently of me I am travelworn My faltering feet are pierced with many a thorn Forgive O hearts estranged forgive I plead When ceaseless bliss is mine I shall not need The tenderness for which I long tonight

Let us forget and forgive injuries

Even a stopped clock is right twice a day

It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

It is very easy to forgive others their mistakes it takes more grit and gumption to forgive them for having witnessed your own

When you pray for anyone you tend to modify your personal attitude toward him

Forgiving means to pardon the unpardonable faith means believing the unbelievable and hoping means to hope when things are hopeless

To err is human to forgive divine

Normal day let me be aware of the treasure you are Let me learn from you love you bless you before you depart Let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow Let me hold you while I may for it may not always be so One day I shall dig my nails into the earth or bury my face in the pillow or stretch myself taut or raise my hands to the sky and want more than all the world your return

The unthankful heart discovers no mercies but let the thankful heart sweep through the day and as the magnet finds the iron so it will find in every hour some heavenly blessings

Joy is what happens to us when we allow ourselves to recognize how good things really are

Good heavens of what uncostly material is our earthly happiness composed if we only knew it What incomes have we not had from a flower and how unfailing are the dividends of the seasons

Be on the lookout for mercies The more we look for them the more of them we will see Better to loose count while naming your blessings than to lose your blessings to counting your troubles

The man who thinks his wife his baby his house his horse his dog and himself severely unequalled is almost sure to be a goodhumored person

Every dog has its day but its not every dog that knows when hes having it

We must give ourselves more earnestly and intelligently and generously than we have to the happy duty of appreciation

There is nothing so bitter that a patient mind cannot find some solace for it

I thank You God for this most amazing day for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes

My private measure of success is daily If this were to be the last day of my life would I be content with it To live in a harmonious balance of commitments and pleasures is what I strive for

Yes there is a Nirvanah it is in leading your sheep to a green pasture and in putting your child to sleep and in writing the last line of your poem

Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting

That daily life is really good one appreciates when one wakes from a horrible dream or when one takes the first outing after a sickness Why not realize it now

Thank God every morning when you get up that you have something to do which must be done whether you like it or not

When I first open my eyes upon the morning meadows and look out upon the beautiful world I thank God I am alive

Each day comes bearing its own gifts Untie the ribbons

We can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth and for the great benefits of our being our life health and reason we look upon ourselves as under no obligation

When something does not insist on being noticed when we arent grabbed by the collar or struck on the skull by a presence or an event we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude

Why do some people always see beautiful skies and grass and lovely flowers and incredible human beings while others are hardpressed to find anything or any place that is beautiful

Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted

My country gave me schooling independence of action and opportunity for service I am indebted to my country beyond any human power to repay

Dwell upon the brightest parts in every prospect and strive to be pleased with the present circumstances

We are never either so wretched or so happy as we say we are

The best things are nearest breath in your nostrils light in your eyes flowers at your feet duties at your hand the path of God just before you Then do not grasp at the stars but do lifes plain common work as it comes certain that daily duties and daily bread are the sweetest things of life

Is life so wretched Isnt it rather your hands which are too small your vision which is muddled You are the one who must grow up

Looking for Silver Linings Our real blessings often appear to us in the shape of pains losses and disappointments

Most of my major disappointments have turned out to be blessings in disguise So whenever anything bad does happen to me I kind of sit back and feel well if I give this enough time itll turn out that this was good so I shant worry about it too much

Sometimes the best deals are the ones you dont make

The advantages of a losing team i There is everything to hope for and nothing to fear 2 Defeats do not disturb ones sleep 3 An occasional victory is a surprise and a delight 4 There is no danger of any club passing you 5 You are not asked fifty times a day What was the score people take it for granted that you lost

That which does not kill me makes me stronger

Not being beautiful was the true blessing Not being beautiful forced me to develop my inner resources The pretty girl has a handicap to overcome

The difficulties hardships and trials of life the obstacles are positive blessings They knit the muscles more firmly and teach selfreliance

Many a man curses the rain that falls upon his head and knows not that it brings abundance to drive away hunger

Trouble is only opportunity in work clothes

Adversity has the same effect on a man that severe training has on the pugilist it reduces him to his fighting weight

You will never be the person you can be if pressure tension and discipline are taken out of your life

Some troubles like a protested note of a solvent debtor bear interest

Failure changes for the better success for the worse

The basis of optimism is sheer terror

No evil is without its compensation it is not the loss itself but the estimate of the loss that troubles us

Let me embrace thee sour adversity for wise men say it is the wisest course

Give thanks for sorrow that teaches you pity for pain that teaches you courageand give exceeding thanks for the mystery which remains a mystery stillthe veil that hides you from the infinite which makes it possible for you to believe in what you cannot see

A Christian could even give thanks for Hell because Hell was a threat and a warning to keep him in the right way

To every disadvantage there is a corresponding advantage

Too many people miss the silver lining because theyre expecting gold

If you count all your assets you always show a profit

Too happy would you be did ye but know your own advantages

Much unhappiness results from our inability to remember the nice things that happen to us

If we go down into ourselves we find that we possess exactly what we desire

Be grateful for yourself be thankful

Keep a grateful journal Every night list five things that you are grateful for What it will begin to do is change your perspective of your day and your life

There is no wealth but life

Just to be is a blessing Just to live is holy

Life may be hard but its also wonderful

I like living I have sometimes been wildly despairingly acutely miserable racked with sorrow but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing

Be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love and to work and to play and to look up at the stars

To be alive to be able to see to walk its all a miracle I have adapted the technique of living life from miracle to miracle

This is another day Are its eyes blurred With maudlin grief for any wasted past A thousand thousand failures shall not daunt Let dust clasp dust death death I am alive

The mere sense of living is joy enough

However mean your life is meet it and live it do not shun it and call it hard names It is not so bad as you are It looks poorest when you are richest The faultfinder will find faults even in Paradise Love your life

Life is the first gift love is the second and understanding the third

To have a full stomach and fixed income are no small things

For one mother joy is the quiet pleasure found in gently rubbing shampoo into her young childs hair For another woman its taking a long walk alone while for yet another its reveling in a muchanticipated vacation

How can they say my life is not a success Have I not for more than sixty years gotten enough to eat and escaped being eaten

Sunshine is delicious rain is refreshing wind braces us up snow is exhilarating there is really no such thing as bad weather only different kinds of good weather

Only a stomach that rarely feels hungry scorns common things

My gratitude for good writing is unbounded Im grateful for it the way Im grateful for the ocean

Is it so small a thing to have enjoyed the sun to have lived light in the spring to have loved to have thought to have done

When something does not insist on being noticed when we arent grabbed by the collar or struck on the skull by a presence or an event we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude

You say grace before meals All right But I say grace before the concert and the opera and grace before the play and pantomime and grace before I open a book and grace before sketching painting swimming fencing boxing walking playing dancing and grace before I dip the pen in the ink

Thank God for dirty dishes they have a tale to tell While other folks go hungry were eating pretty well With home and health and happiness we shouldnt want to fuss For by this stack of evidence Gods very good to us

It is strange what a contempt men have for the joys that are offered them freely

Grateful for the blessing lent of simple tastes and mind content

An easy thing O Power Divine To thank thee for these gifts of Thine For summers sunshine winters snow For hearts that kindle thoughts that glow But when shall I attain to this To thank Thee for the things I miss

People call me an optimist but Im really an appreciator years ago I was cured of a badly infected finger with antibiotics when once my doctor could have recommended only a hot water soak or eventually surgery When I was six years old and had scarlet fever the first of the miracle drugs sulfanilamide saved my life Im grateful for computers and photocopiers I appreciate where weve come from

If only the people who worry about their liabilities would think about the riches they do possess they would stop worrying Would you sell both your eyes for a million dollars or your two legs or your hands or your hearing Add up what you do have and youll find that you wont sell them for all the gold in the world The best things in life are yours if you can appreciate yourself

We can be thankful to a friend for a few acres or a little money and yet for the freedom and command of the whole earth and for the great benefits of our being our life health and reason we look upon ourselves as under no obligation

Health is a blessing that money cannot buy

Happiness lies first of all in health

A sound mind in a sound body is a short but full description of a happy state in this world

Health is the vital principle of bliss

If you cant be thankful for what you receive be thankful for what you escape

Even though we cant have all we want we ought to be thankful we dont get all we deserve

Happy the man who can count his sufferings

Happiness is composed of misfortunes avoided

Considering the fortune you might have lost youll have to admit youre rich already

I thank Thee first because I was never robbed before second because although they took my purse they did not take my life third because although they took my all it was not much and fourth because it was I who was robbed and not I who robbed

Think of the ills from which you are exempt

A man should always consider how much more unhappy he might be than he is

The happiness of any given life is to be measured not by its joys and pleasures but by the extent to which it has been free from suffering from positive evil

Better to suffer than to die

Better a little fire to warm us than a great one to burn us

It isnt important to come out on top What matters is to come out alive

He who limps still walks

I have gout asthma and seven other maladies but am otherwise very well

Luckily I never feel at one time more than half my pains

Pain is no longer pain when it is past

We are content to forgo joy when pain is also lost

The happiest is he who suffers the least pain the most miserable he who enjoys the least pleasure

Happiness is not being pained in body or troubled in mind

The end of pain we take as happiness

You can be happy indeed if you have breathing space from pain

The summit of pleasure is the elimination of all that gives pain

I seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain

A prudent man will think more important what fate has conceded to him than what it has denied

It is better to be looked over than overlooked

Blessed are those who can give without remembering and take without forgetting

He is a man of sense who does not grieve for what he has not but rejoices in what he has

Enjoy the successes that you have and dont be too hard on yourself when you dont do well Too many times we beat up on ourselves Just relax and enjoy it

For everything you have missed you have gained something else

Few love what they may have

The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us

May we never let the things we cant have or dont have spoil our enjoyment of the things we do have and can have

It is not customary to love what one has

The talent for being happy is appreciating and liking what you have instead of what you dont have

Happy thou art not for what thou hast not still thou strivest to get and what thou hast forgetest

Men always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got

When we cannot get what we love we must love what is within our reach

Take full account of the excellencies which you possess and in gratitude remember how you would hanker after them if you had them not

A wise man cares not for what he cannot have

A man can refrain from wanting what he has not and cheerfully make the best of a bird in the hand

Long only for what you have

The tulip is among flowers what the peacock is among birds A tulip lacks scent a peacock has an unpleasant voice The one takes pride in its garb the other in its tail

Slight not what is near though aiming at what is far

Greediness of getting more deprives the enjoyment of what it had got

There is a mortal breed most full of futility In contempt of what is at hand they strain into the future hunting impossibilities on the wings of ineffectual hopes

What you really value is what you miss not what you have

While you fear missing a meal you arent fully aware of the meals you do eat

To be upset over what you dont have is to waste what you do have

If theres no bread cakes are very good

Not what we have but what we enjoy constitutes our abundance

Not what we have but what we use not what we see but what we choosethese are the things that mar or bless human happiness

The happiness which is lacking makes one think even the happiness one has unbearable

We always have enough to be happy if we are enjoying what we do have and not worrying about what we dont have

Welcome everything that comes to you but do not long for anything else

The superiority of the distant over the present is only due to the mass and variety of the pleasures that can be suggested compared with the poverty of those that can at any time be felt

If there is a sin against life it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life

Mankind by the perverse depravity of their nature esteem that which they have most desired as of no value the moment it is possessed and torment themselves with fruitless wishes for that which is beyond their reach

All your youth you want to have your greatness taken for granted when you find it taken for granted you are unnerved

Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not remember that what you now have was once among the things only hoped for

It aint so much trouble to get rich as it is to tell when we have got rich

What you have become is the price you paid to get what you used to want

No man can be satisfied with his attainment although he may be satisfied with his circumstances

Life is a progress from want to want not from enjoyment to enjoyment

We spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it

There must be more to life than having everything

Is there no end to this escalation of desire

Ambition has its disappointments to sour us but never the good fortune to satisfy us

There is no banquet but some dislike something in it

If we get everything that we want we will soon want nothing that we get

It matters very little whether a man is discontented in the name of pessimism or progress if his discontent does in fact paralyse his power of appreciating what he has got

The best things in life are appreciated most after they have been lost

Only with a new ruler do you realize the value of the old

I remember those happy days and often wish I could speak into the ears of the dead the gratitude which was due to them in life and so illreturned

You cant appreciate home until youve left it money till its spent your wife till shes joined a womans club nor Old Glory till you see it hanging on a broomstick on the shanty of a consul in a foreign town

Birds sing after a storm why shouldnt people feel as free to delight in whatever remains to them

Think of all the beauty still left around you and be happy

Oh my friend its not what they take away from you that countsits what you do with what you have left

God gave you a gift of 86400 seconds today Have you used one to say thank you

So long as we can lose any happiness we possess some

Happiness always looks small while you hold it in your hands but let it go and you learn at once how big and precious it is

After my mothers death I began to see her as she had really been It was less like losing someone than discovering someone

We never know the worth of water till the well is dry

The way to love anything is to realize that it may be lost

Jesus please teach me to appreciate what I have before time forces me to appreciate what I had

Eden is that oldfashioned house we dwell in every day Without suspecting our abode until we drive away

Generally the man with a good wife or the woman with a good husband or the children with good parents discover too late the goodness they overlooked while it was in full bloom

Jesus please teach me to appreciate what I have before time forces me to appreciate what I had

The Pilgrims made seven times more graves than huts No Americans have been more impoverished than these who nevertheless set aside a day of thanksgiving

The greatest saint in the world is not he who prays most or fasts most it is not he who gives alms or is most eminent for temperance chastity or justice It is he who is most thankful to God

Not what we say about our blessings but how we use them is the true measure of our thanksgiving

The unthankful heart discovers no mercies but the thankful heart will find in every hour some heavenly blessings

Thanksgiving is a sure index of spiritual health

If the only prayer you say in your whole life is Thank you that would suffice

Who does not thank for little will not thank for much

The beginning of mens rebellion against God was and is the lack of a thankful heart

A thankful heart is not only the greatest virtue but the parent of all other virtues

Seeds of discouragement will not grow in the thankful heart

The private and personal blessings we enjoythe blessings of immunity safeguard liberty and integrity deserve the thanksgiving of a whole life

One of lifes gifts is that each of us no matter how tired and downtrodden finds reasons for thankfulness

Joy is the simplest form of gratitude

He who receives a benefit with gratitude repays the first installment on his debt

Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life It turns what we have into enough and more It turns denial into acceptance chaos to order confusion to clarity It can turn a meal into a feast a house into a home a stranger into a friend Gratitude makes sense of our past brings peace for today and creates a vision for tomorrow

Remember that not to be happy is not to be grateful

Gratitude weighs heavy on us only when we no longer feel it

Appreciation is yeast lifting ordinary to extraordinary

Gratitude is the memory of the heart

One can never pay in gratitude one can only pay in kind somewhere else in life

Silent gratitude isnt much use to anyone

Happiness is itself a kind of gratitude

One cannot collect all the beautiful shells on the beach

A man who accustoms himself to buy superfluities is often in want of necessities

What is the proper limit for wealth It is first to have what is necessary and second to have what is enough

He has enough who is contented with little

There is a great difference between satisfaction and satiation

More than enough is too much

Its a grand thing to be able to take your money in your hand and to think no more of it when it slips away from you than you would a trout that would slip back into the stream

Let him who has enough wish for nothing more

Nothing is enough to the man for whom enough is too little

Sufficiencys enough for men of sense

You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough

Enough is as good as a feast

There is satiety in all things in sleep and lovemaking in the loveliness of singing and the innocent dance

The average man is rich enough when he has a little more than he has got

A wise man will desire no more than what he may get justly use soberly distribute cheerfully and leave contently

Money and time are the heaviest burdens of life and the unhappiest of all mortals are those who have more of either than they know how to use

Whoever is not in his coffin and the dark grave let him know he has enough

Too much is unwholesome

This only grant me that my means may lie too low for envy for contempt too high

Moderation is the key to lasting enjoyment

Nothing in excess

Ask the gods nothing excessive

Avarice is as destitute of what it has as poverty is of what it has not

Philosophy should not pretend to increase our present stock but make us economists of what we are possessed of

The use we make of our fortune determines as to its sufficiency A little is enough if used wisely and too much is not enough if expended foolishly

It is possible to own too much A man with one watch knows what time it is a man with two watches is never quite sure

Happiness is a way station between too much and too little

To be able to dispense with good things is tantamount to possessing them

We dont need to increase our goods nearly as much as we need to scale down our wants Not wanting something is as good as possessing it

The hardest thing is to take less when you can get more

Whoever does not regard what he has as most ample wealth is unhappy though he is master of the world

I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires rather than in attempting to satisfy them

How few are our real wants and how easy is it to satisfy them Our imaginary ones are boundless and insatiable

Of all the people in the world those who want the most are those who have the most

Who covets more is evermore a slave

If you desire many things many things will seem but a few

The heart is great which shows moderation in the midst of prosperity

Want is a growing giant whom the coat of Have was never large enough to cover

Freedom is not procured by a full enjoyment of what is desired but by controlling the desire

How many things there are which I do not want

Moderate desires constitute a character fitted to acquire all the good which the world can yield He who has this character is prepared in whatever situation he is therewith to be content and has learned the science of being happy

Were a man to order his life by the rules of true reason a frugal substance joined to a contented mind is for him great riches

One is never fortunate or as unfortunate as one imagines

Man needs so little yet he begins wanting so much

Man never has what he wants because what he wants is everything

If your desires be endless your cares and fears will be so too

We are no longer happy so soon as we wish to be happier

He is not rich that possesses much but he that covets no more and he is not poor that enjoys little but he that wants too much

Independence may be found in comparative as well as in absolute abundance I mean where a person contracts his desires within the limits of his fortune

One never hugs ones good luck so affectionately as when listening to the relation of some horrible misfortunes which has overtaken others

If you would but exchange places with the other fellow how much more you could appreciate your own position

We should learn by reflection on the misfortunes of others that there is nothing singular in those which befall ourselves

Doubleno tripleour troubles and wed still be better off than any other people on earth

I wept because I had no shoes until I saw a man who had no feet

When lifes problems seem overwhelming look around and see what other people are coping with You may consider yourself fortunate

If all misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion most people would be contented to take their own and depart

Not he who has little but he who wishes more is poor

The covetous man is always poor

He is not poor that hath not much but he that craves much

He is poor who does not feel content

I have no riches but my thoughts Yet these are wealth enough for me

He who curbs his desires will always be rich enough

There is a gigantic difference between earning a great deal of money and being rich

That man is richest whose pleasures are the cheapest

If you want an accounting of your worth count your friends

Ive had an exciting life I married for love and got a little money along with it

True affluence is not needing anything

There are many excuses for the person who made the mistake of confounding money and wealth Like many others they mistook the sign for the thing signified

Friends are the thermometer by which we may judge the temperature of our fortunes

To be satisfied with what one has that is wealth As long as one sorely needs a certain additional amount that man isnt rich

I have the greatest of all riches that of not desiring them

My friends are my estate

A man is rich in proportion to the things he can afford to let alone

There are people who have money and people who are rich

He is rich that is satisfied

Nor need we power or splendor wide hall or lordly dome the good the true the tenderthese form the wealth of home

He is well paid that is well satisfied

He who is content in his poverty is wonderfully rich

He who is contented is rich

A BMW cant take you as far as a diploma

All fortune belongs to him who has a contented mind

The greatest wealth is contentment with a little

No one has yet had the courage to memorialize his wealth on his tombstone A dollar mark would not look well there

So many of us define ourselves by what we have what we wear what kind of house we live in and what kind of car we drive if you think of yourself as the woman in the Cartier watch and the Hermes scarf a house fire will destroy not only your possessions but your self

The externals are simply so many props everything we need is within us

He is not rich that possesses much but he that is content with what he has

One wellcultivated talent deepened and enlarged is worth one hundred shallow faculties

If only every man would make proper use of his strength and do his utmost he need never regret his limited ability

Anyone is to be pitied who has just sense enough to perceive his deficiencies

What strange perversity is it that induces a man to set his heart on doing those things which he has not succeeded in and makes him slight those in which his achievement has been respectable

I may not amount to much but at least I am unique

Happy is the man who can do only one thing in doing it he fulfills his destiny

The real tragedy of life is not being limited to one talent but in failing to use that one talent

Too many people overvalue what they are not and undervalue what they are

Nothing will content him who is not content with a little

Contentment is worth more than riches

I figure if I have my health can pay the rent and I have my friends I call it content

Be content with what thou hast received and smooth thy frowning forehead

He is poor who does not feel content

If thou covetest riches ask not but for contentment which is an immense treasure

Who is content with nothing possesses all things

My crown is called content a crown that seldom kings enjoy

It is right to be contented with what we have never with what we are

Be content with your lot one cannot be first in everything

Content may dwell in all stations To be low but above contempt may be high enough to be happy

He is not rich that possesses much but he that is content with what he has

True contentment is the power of getting out of any situation all that there is in it It is arduous and it is rare

Poor and content is rich and rich enough

The greatest wealth is contentment with a little

And be content with such things as ye have

Everything has its wonders even darkness and silence and I learn whatever state I may be in therein to be content

Try to live the life of the good man who is more than content with what is allocated to him

The world is full of people looking for spectacular happiness while they snub contentment

We are never content with our lot

Until you make peace with who you are youll never be content with what you have

True contentment depends not upon what we have a tub was large enough for Diogenes but a world was too little for Alexander

To be content with little is difficult to be content with much impossible

Reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has many not on your past misfortunes of which all men have some

No longer forward nor behind I look in hope or fear But grateful take the good I find The best of now and here

What a wonderful life Ive had I only wish Id realized it sooner

Was it always my nature to take a bad time and block out the good times until any success became an accident and failure seemed the only truth

Most human beings have an almost infinite capacity for taking things for granted

There are men who are happy without knowing it

We are all of us richer than we think we are

What a miserable thing life is youre living in clover only the clover isnt good enough

I am convinced the longer I live that life and its blessings are not so entirely unjustly distributed as when we are suffering greatly we are inclined to suppose

Life is hard Next to what

Over a period of time its been driven home to me that Im not going to be the most popular writer in the world so Im always happy when anything in any way is accepted

It made me gladsome to be getting some education it being like a big window opening

Too much of a good thing can be wonderful

A man with ambition and love for his blessings here on earth is ever so alive Having been alive it wont be so hard in the end to lie down and rest

In the country of the blind the oneeyed man is king

Be satisfied and pleased with what thou art Act cheerfully and well thou allotted part Enjoy the present hour be thankful for the past And neither fear nor wish the approaches of the last

No one is satisfied with his fortune or dissatisfied with his intellect

Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

God pardons like a mother who kisses the offense into everlasting forgetfulness

Good to forgive Best to forget

It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

His heart was as great as the world but there was no room in it to hold the memory of a wrong

Bear and forbear

Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us

To err is human to forgive divine

Forgive others often yourself never

It is manlike to punish but godlike to forgive

Fortune makes him fool whom she makes her darling

It is fortune not wisdom that rules mans life

Fortune truly helps those who are of good judgment

The bitter dregs of Fortunes cup to drain

Fortunes made in no time are like shirts made in no time its ten to one if they hang long together

Men are seldom blessed with good fortune and good sense at the same time

Fortune and Love befriend the bold

Every man is the architect of his own fortune

O fortune fortune all men call thee fickle

There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune

A sleeping fox counts hens in his dreams

Frailty thy name is woman

An amiable weakness

Forty million Frenchmen cant be wrong

France freed from that monster Bonaparte must again become the most agreeable country on earth It would be the second choice of all whose ties of family and fortune give a preference to some other one and the first choice of all not under those ties

Ye sons of France awake to glory Hark Hark what myriads bid you rise Your children wives and grandsires hoary Behold their tears and hear their cries

France always has plenty men of talent but it is always deficient in men of action and high character

The cause of freedom is the cause of God

Life is not so short but that there is always time enough for courtesy

A decent boldness ever meets with friends

It is not enough to succeed a friend must fail

A friend in power is a friend lost

A friend is one before whom I may think aloud

Iron sharpeneth man so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend

Chance makes our parents but choice makes our friends

Hope is a pleasant acquaintance but an unsafe friend

Money cant buy friends but you can get a better class of enemy

Every time I paint a portrait I lose a friend

My heart is warm with the friends I make And better friends Ill not be knowing Yet there isnt a train I wouldnt take No matter where its going

A sympathetic friend can be quite dear as a brother

Friends are relatives you make for yourself

A good friend is my nearest relation

The rich know not who is his friend

The richer your friends the more they will cost you

A friend in need is a friend indeed

It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

Mans best support is a very dear friend

If you want an accounting of your worth count your friends

A true friend is the best possession

Best friend my wellspring in the wilderness

The only way to have a friend is to be one

A friend should be a master at guessing and keeping still

I have lost friends some by death others by sheer inability to cross the street

Faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful

An old friend never can be found and nature has provided that he cannot easily be lost

One whos our friend is fond of us one whos fond of us isnt necessarily our friend

True friends face in the same direction toward common projects interests goals

Friends are a second existence

My helpless friend your helplessness is the most powerful plea which rises up to the tender fatherheart of God You think that everything is closed to you because you cannot pray My friend your helplessness is the very essence of prayer

A decent boldness ever meets with friends

Jimmy and I were always partners

He Winston Churchill has a future and I have a past so we should be all right

Parents are friends that life gives us friends are parents that the heart chooses

My father was generous with his affection given to great awkward engulfing hugs and I can remember so clearly the smell of his hugs all starched shirt tobacco Old Spice and Cutty Sark Sometimes I think Ive never been properly hugged since

Both within the family and without our sisters hold up our mirrors our images of who we are and of who we can dare to become

Sisters define their rivalry in terms of competition for the gold cup of parental love It is never perceived as a cup which runneth over rather a finite vessel from which the more one sister drinks the less is left over for the others

The desire to be and have a sister is a primitive and profound one that may have everything or nothing to do with the family a woman is born to It is a desire to know and be known by someone who shares blood and body history and dreams

Where there is lasting love there is a family

Is solace anywhere more comforting than in the arms of sisters

Call it a clan call it a network call it a tribe call it a family Whatever you call it whoever you are you need one

Old as she was she still missed her daddy sometimes

Families are made to make you forget yourself occasionally so that the beautiful balance of life is not destroyed

The family unit plays a critical role in our society and in the training of the generation to come

All love that has not friendship for its base Is like a mansion built upon the sand

One can find traces of every life in each life

Good friendships are fragile things and require as much care as any other fragile and precious thing

Remember that you are all people and that all people are you

The only way to have a friend is to be one

Friendships like marriages are dependent on avoiding the unforgivable

Confidence is the foundation of friendship If we give it we will receive it

There is a definite process by which one made people into friends and it involved talking to them and listening to them for hours at a time

Actions not words are the true criterion of the attachment of friends

One who knows how to show and to accept kindness will be a friend better than any possession

Any man will usually get from other men what he is expecting from them If he is looking for friendship he will likely receive it If his attitude is that of indifference it will beget indifference And if a man is looking for a fight he will in all likelihood be accommodated in that

There is nothing we like to see so much as the gleam of pleasure in a persons eye when he feels that we have sympathized with him understood him interested ourself in his welfare At these moments something fine and spiritual passes between two friends These moments are the moments worth living

He does good to himself who does good to his friend

A sense of duty is useful in work but offensive in personal relations People wish to be liked not endured with patient resignation

When a friend is in trouble dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do Think up something appropriate and do it

Loyalty is what we seek in friendship

True friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable

If two friends ask you to judge a dispute dont accept because you will lose one friend on the other hand if two strangers come with the same request accept because you will gain one friend

Perhaps the most delightful friendships are those in which there is much agreement much disputation and yet more personal liking

There can be no friendship when there is no freedom Friendship loves the free air and will not be fenced up in straight and narrow enclosures

You will find yourself refreshed by the presence of cheerful people Why not make earnest effort to confer that pleasure on othersHalf the battle is gained if you never allow yourself to say anything gloomy

Wear a smile and have friends wear a scowl and have wrinkles

Lead the life that will make you kindly and friendly to everyone about you and you will be surprised what a happy life you will live

Those who cannot give friendship will rarely receive it and never hold it

It is not the services we render them but the services they render us that attaches people to us

We cherish our friends not for their ability to amuse us but for ours to amuse them

It is foolish to make experiments upon the constancy of a friend as upon the chastity of a wife

Give and take makes good friends

A quarrel between friends when made up adds a new tie to friendship as the callosity formed round a broken bone makes it stronger than before

No real friendship is ever made without an initial clashing which discloses the metal of each to each

Nothing wounds a friend like a want of confidence

The first thing to learn in intercourse with others is noninterference with their own peculiar ways of being happy provided those ways do not assume to interfere with ours

No man can have society upon his own terms If he seeks it he must serve it too

We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed As in filling a vessel drop by drop there is at last a drop which makes it run over So in a series of kindnesses there is at last one which makes the heart run over

Friendship is a plant which must be often watered

A friend should bear his friends infirmities

No man is much pleased with a companion who does not increase in some respect his fondness of himself

You win the victory when you yield to friends

The condition which high friendship demands is the ability to do without it

Women can form a friendship with a man very well but to preserve it a slight physical antipathy most probably helps

Love your friends as if they would some day hate you

Friendship is a strong and habitual inclination in two persons to promote the good and happiness of one another

Friendship is the pleasing game of interchanging praise

The hardest of all is learning to be a well of affection and not a fountain to show them that we love them not when we feel like it but when they do

If you want to be listened to you should put in time listening

Stay is a charming word in a friends vocabulary

The only service a friend can really render is to keep up your courage by holding up to you a mirror in which you can see a noble image of yourself

The way to make a true friend is to be one Friendship implies loyalty esteem cordiality sympathy affection readiness to aid to help to stick to fight for if need be Radiate friendship and it will return sevenfold

The most calledupon prerequisite of a friend is an accessible ear

A loyal friend laughs at your jokes when theyre not so good and sympathizes with your problems when theyre not so bad

Politeness is an inexpensive way of making friends

The secret of success in society is a certain heartiness and sympathy

Sometimes we owe a friend to the lucky circumstance that we give him no cause for envy

Friendship requires great communication

Friendship requires more time than poor busy men can usually command

We should behave to our friends as we would wish our friends to behave to us

You can make more friends in two months by becoming more interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get people interested in you

We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by doing them

Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil Tis the sole remedy against misfortune the very ventilation of the soul

It is easier to visit friends than to live with them

The loneliness you get by the sea is personal and alive It doesnt subdue you and make you feel abject Its stimulating loneliness

The chain of friendship however bright does not stand the attrition of constant close contact

Fond as we are of our loved ones there comes at times during their absence an unexplained peace

Friendship increases in visiting friends but not in visiting them too often

Go oft to the house of thy friend for weeds choke the unused path

I am quite sure that no friendship yields its true pleasure and nobility of nature without frequent communication sympathy and service

I am learning to live close to the lives of my friends without ever seeing them No miles of any measurement can separate your soul from mine

The most beautiful discovery true friends make is that they can grow separately without growing apart

Friends are lost by calling often and calling seldom

A hedge between keeps friendships green

Solitude is one thing and loneliness is another

My friend and I have built a wall Between us thick and wide The stones of it are laid in scorn And plastered high with pride

When my friends lack an eye I look at them in profile

You can always tell a real friend when youve made a fool of yourself he doesnt feel youve done a permanent job

A friend is one who withholds judgment no matter how long you have his unanswered letter

The best rule of friendship is to keep your heart a little softer than your head

Who seeks a faultless friend remains friendless

Unless you bear with the faults of a friend you betray your own

Probably no man ever had a friend he did not dislike a little we are all so constituted by nature that no one can possibly entirely approve of us

Love your friend with his fault

It is well when judging a friend to remember that he is judging you with the same godlike and superior impartiality

Two persons cannot long be friends if they cannot forgive each others little failings

To find a friend one must close one eye To keep him two

It is easier to forgive an enemy than a friend

Sooner or later youve heard all your best friends have to say Then comes the tolerance of real love

We shall never have friends if we expect to find them without fault

It is well there is no one without fault for he would not have a friend in the world He would seem to belong to a different species

The essence of true friendship is to make allowance for anothers little lapses

To be social is to be forgiving

It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them

It is better to be deceived by ones friends than to deceive them

The man who trusts other men will make fewer mistakes than he who distrusts them

It should be part of our private ritual to devote a quarter of an hour every day to the enumeration of the good qualities of our friends When we are not active we fall back idly upon defects even of those whom we most love

Friendship admits of difference of character as love does that of sex

Between friends there is no need of justice

What I cannot love I overlook

Treat your fiends as you do your picture and place them in their best light

Friendships arent perfect and yet they are very precious For me not expecting perfection all in one place was a great release

Being considerate of others will take you and your children further in life than any college or professional degree

Nothing is ever lost by courtesy It is the cheapest of pleasures costs nothing and conveys much It pleases him who gives and receives and thus like mercy is twice blessed

Truth is a rough honest helterskelter terrier that none like to see brought into their drawing rooms

Friendship cannot live with ceremony nor without civility

Dont flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates The nearer you come into relation with a person the more necessary do tact and courtesy become

Friends are like a pleasant park where you wish to go while you may enjoy the flowers you may not eat them

Friendship is honey but dont eat it all

Except in cases of necessity which are rare leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies they are ready enough to tell him

Its important to our friends to believe that we are unreservedly frank with them and important to our friendship that we are not

Dont tell your friends their social faults they will cure the fault and never forgive you

There are worse words than cuss words there are words that hurt

Nobody likes having salt rubbed into their wounds even if it is the salt of the earth

Flattery makes friends truth enemies

Before a secret is told one can often feel the weight of it in the atmosphere

A cruel story runs on wheels and every hand oils the wheels as they run

It is terrible to destroy a persons picture of himself in the interests of truth or some other abstraction

If we all told what we know of one another there would not be four friends in the world

We all need somebody to talk to It would be good if we talked not just pitterpatter but real talk We shouldnt be so afraid because most people really like this contact that you show you are vulnerable makes them free to be vulnerable

If we were all given by magic the power to read each others thoughts I suppose the first effect would be to dissolve all friendships

The truth that is suppressed by friends is the readiest weapon of the enemy

I hope you live to be as old as your jokes

My wife is the most wonderful woman in the world and thats not just my opinion its hers

she Before we got married you told me you were welloff he I was and I didnt know it

A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband

Why did God make man before he made woman Because he didnt want any advice on how to do it

The best way to remember your wifes birthday is to forget it once

Shes too young for Medicare and too old for me to care

Gray hair is Gods graffiti

I lived in Miami for a while in a section with a lot of really old people The average age in my apartment house was dead

Good Americans when they die go to Paris

We had a very successful trip to Russia we got back

Enjoy life Think of all the women who passed up dessert on the Titanic

Everybody should believe in something I believe Ill have another drink

I know lots more old drunks than old doctors

Im a onedrink woman two at the most three Im under the table four Im under the host

My doctor said I look like a million dollars green and wrinkled

Condoms arent completely safe A friend of mine was wearing one and got hit by a bus

My doctor gave me six months to live but when I couldnt pay the bill he gave me six months more

I cant believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm you were the quickest

I hope you live to be as old as your jokes

My wife is the most wonderful woman in the world and thats not just my opinion its hers

she Before we got married you told me you were welloff he I was and I didnt know it

A good marriage would be between a blind wife and a deaf husband

Why did God make man before he made woman Because he didnt want any advice on how to do it

When all else is lost the future still remains

Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore And coming events cast their shadows before

I never think of the future It comes soon enough

I know of no way of judging the future but by the past

The present is great with the future

Trust no Future howeer pleasant Let the dead Past bury its dead

Go forth to meet the shadowy Future without fear and with a manly heart

Take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof

There was the Door to which I found no key There was the Veil through which I might not see

There was a wise man in the East whose constant prayer was that he might see today with the eyes of tomorrow

I believe the future is only the past again entered through another gate

Till the sun grows cold And the stars are old And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold

The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong but thats the way to bet

There is but one good throw upon the dice which is to throw them away

By gaming we lose both our time and treasure two things most precious to the life of man

Man is a gaming animal

Keep flax from fire youth from gaming

It gaming is the child of avarice the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief

Play out the game act well your part and if the gods have blundered we will not

Business is more exciting than any game

Divorce is a game played by lawyers

Poetry is a mugs game

The game isnt over until its over

I never lost a game I just ran out of time

Most ball games are lost not won

In the game of life nothing is less important than the score at half time

The game of life is not so much in holding a good hand as playing a poor hand well

The game is not worth the candle

A garden is a lovesome thing God wot Rose plot Fringed pool Fern grot The veriest school Of peace and yet the fool Contends that God is not Not God in gardens When the sun is cool Nay but I have a sign Tis very sure God walks in mine

God the first garden made and the first city Cain

The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed

One is nearer Gods heart in a garden Than anywhere else on earth

The difference between genius and stupidity is that genius has its limits

The genius of Einstein leads to Hiroshima

Genius in truth means little more than the faculty of perceiving in an unhabitual way

Genius as such can neither be explained nor treated away only at times its delay and inhibition and its perversion to destructive or selfdestructive ends

To believe your own thought to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men that is genius

Doing easily what others find is difficult is talent doing what is impossible for talent is genius

It takes immense genius to represent simply and sincerely what we see in front of us

Results Why man I have gotten a lot of results I know several thousand things that wont work

The parting genius is with sighing sent

Every man of genius is considerably helped by being dead

In the republic of mediocrity genius is dangerous

We define genius as the capacity for productive reaction against ones training

Before I was a genius I was a drudge

In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty

Genius develops in quiet places character out in the full current of human life

Men of genius are the worst possible models for men of talent

The public is wonderfully tolerant It forgives everything except genius

When a true genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign that the dunces are all in confederacy against him

Talent is that which is in a mans power genius is that in whose power a man is

There is a thin line between genius and insanity I have erased this line

Improvement makes straight roads but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius

Geniuses are the luckiest of mortals because what they must do is the same as what they most want to do

Everyone is a genius at least once a year a real genius has his original ideas closer together

The true genius is a mind of large general powers accidentally determined to some particular direction

The mark of genius is an incessant activity of mind Genius is a spiritual greed

Genius is an African who dreams up snow

Sometimes men come by the name of genius in the same way that certain insects come by the name of centipede not because they have a hundred feet but because most people cant count above fourteen

Too often we forget that genius depends upon the data within its reach that Archimedes could not have devised Edisons inventions

There is no great genius without a mixture of madness

Genius is only great patience

Genius is one per cent inspiration and ninetynine per cent perspiration

Genius does what it must and talent does what it can

Gift like genius I often think only means an infinite capacity for taking pains

Genius is a promontory jutting out of the infinite

Threefifths of him genius and twofifths sheer fudge

The lamp of genius burns quicker than the lamp of life

The poets scrolls will outlive the monuments of stone The Genius survives all else is claimed by death

A gentleman is man who can disagree without being disagreeable

The gentleman is a Christian product

Once a gentleman always a gentleman

Propriety of manners and consideration for others are the two main characteristics of a gentleman

To make a fine gentleman several trades are required but chiefly a barber

Let us put Germany so to speak in the saddle you will see that she can ride

We Germans will never produce another Goethe but we may produce another Caesar

Act decidedly and take the consequences No good is ever done by hesitation

How lovely to think that no one need wait a moment we can start now start slowly changing the world

To know what has to be done then do it comprises the whole philosophy of practical life

If you want to do something do it

Something must happen

Putting off an easy thing makes it hard Putting off a hard thing makes it impossible

Delay always breeds danger and to protract a great design is often to ruin it

The wise man does at once what the fool does finally

In putting off what one has to do one runs the risk of never being able to do it

Getting an idea should be like sitting down on a pin it should make you jump up and do something

Procrastination is opportunitys assassin

To do anything in this world worth doing we must not stand back shivering and thinking of the cold and danger but jump in and scramble through as well as we can

The man who will not execute his resolutions when they are fresh upon him can have no hope from them afterwards they will be dissipated lost and perish in the hurry and scurry of the world or sunk in the slough of indolence

Why always not yet Do flowers in spring say not yet

We are very near to greatness one step and we are safe can we not take the leap

The keen spirit seizes the prompt occasion

The hour is ripe and yonder lies the way

Delay not to seize the hour

I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one

This one makes a net this one stands and wishes Would you like to make a bet which one gets the fishes

Inspirations never go in for long engagements they demand immediate marriage to action

If we really want to live wed better start at once to try

The rewards in business go to the man who does something with an idea

The important thing is somehow to begin

Eighty percent of success is showing up

As long as you can start you are all right The juice will come

The way to get ahead is to start now

Begin doing what you want to do now

It is no good hearing an inner voice or getting an inner prompting if you do not immediately act on that inner prompting

Even if youre on the right track youll get run over if you just sit there

The first step is the hardest

The art of writing is the art of applying the seat of the pants to the seat of the chair

Every beginning is hard

A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step

Whenever you take a step forward you are bound to disturb something

If you miss the first buttonhole you will not succeed in buttoning up your coat

If you dont place your foot on the rope youll never cross the chasm

He who is outside the door has already a good part of his journey behind him

The beginning is half of every action

The man who removes a mountain begins by carrying away small stones

Everyone who got where he is had to begin where he was

Change your life today Dont gamble on the future act now without delay

The most important thing about getting somewhere is starting right where we are

Sometimes we look so intently toward the pinnacle that we stumble over the steps leading to it Development begins just where you are

Few begin with anything like a clear view of what they want to do and the fortune they seek may come in a very different form from that which they have kept in view

The most effective way to do it is to do it

Beginnings are apt to be shadowy

We will not know unless we begin

Let us watch well our beginnings and results will manage themselves

You cannot contribute anything to the ideal condition of mind and heart known as Brotherhood however much you preach posture or agree unless you live it

The secret of getting ahead is getting started

To always be intending to live a new life but never to find time to set about it this is as if a man should put off eating and drinking and sleeping from one day and night to another till he is starved and destroyed

To choose is also to begin

Knowing is not enough we must apply Willing is not enough we must do

Wisdom is harder to do than it is to know

Justice is a concept Muscle is the reality

No one has a right to sit down and feel hopeless Theres too much work to do

Do noble things do not dream them all day long

That is the principal thing not to remain with the dream with the intention with the being in the mood but always forcibly to convert it into all things

Dont wait for your ship to come in and feel angry and cheated when it doesnt Get going with something small

Dont sit down and wait for the opportunities to come you have to get up and make them

The individual activity of one man with backbone will do more than a thousand men with a mere wishbone

With mere good intentions hell is proverbially paved

All the beautiful sentiments in the world weigh less than a single lovely action

It is vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquility they must have action and they will have it if they cannot find it

Now go take on the day

You cant steal second base and keep one foot on first

You cannot dream yourself into a character you must hammer and forge one for yourself

What the Puritans gave the world was not thought but action

Stagnation is something worse than death It is corruption also

I myself must mix with action lest I wither by despair

Psychology is action not thinking about oneself

The great end of life is not knowledge but action

The biggest sin is sitting on your ass

This is a world of action and not for moping and droning in

Honors and rewards fall to those who show their good qualities in action

Share the passion and action of your time at peril of being judged not to have lived

Action is eloquence

The shortest answer is doing

The end of man is action

Optimism unaccompanied by personal effort is merely a state of mind and not fruitful

To attain happiness in another world we need only to believe something while to secure it in this world we must do something

The only menace is inertia

One of the reasons why so few of us ever act instead of react is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses

If a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake them up

Men expect too much do too little

Action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action

Things dont turn up in this world until somebody turns them up

Actact in the living present

Life is essentially a series of events to be lived through rather than intellectual riddles to be played with and solved

There are risks and costs to a program of action But they are far less than the longrange risks and costs of comfortable inaction

What you dont do can be a destructive force

He that is overcautious will accomplish little

Untilled ground however rich will bring forth thistles and thorns so also the mind of man

Often greater risk is involved in postponement than in making a wrong decision

The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone

And all that you are sorry for is what you havent done

Can anything be sadder than work unfinished Yes work never begun

The only things you regret are the things you didnt do

Above all try something

To avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall

Indifference and inaction must always pay a penalty

Shun idleness It is a rust that attaches itself to the most brilliant metals

I do not believe in a fate that falls on men however they act but I do believe in a fate that falls on men unless they act

The real nature of an ethic is that it does not become an ethic unless and until it goes into action

For it isnt enough to talk about peace One must believe in it And it isnt enough to believe in it One must work at it

Words are mere bubbles of water but deeds are drops of gold

Ef women want any rights moren dey got why dont dey jes take em and not be talkin about it

All talk of womens rights is moonshine Women have every right They have only to exercise them

A man of words and not of deeds is like a garden full of weeds

Life is worth being lived but not worth being discussed all the time

Action not words are the true criterion of the attachment of friends

Words without actions are the assassins of idealism

If you have something to do that is worthwhile doing dont talk about it do it

If deeds are wanting all words appear mere vanity and emptiness

Talking is easy action difficult

Ones feelings waste themselves in words they ought all to be distilled into action which bring results

Boast not of what thou wouldst have done but do

I like to deliver more than I promise instead of the other way around

When I talked no one listened to me But as soon as I acted I became persuasive and I no longer find anyone incredulous

If you can talk brilliantly about a problem it can create the consoling illusion that it has been mastered

Words gain credibility by deed

Men are alike in their promises It is only in their deeds that they differ

An acre of performance is worth a whole world of promise

Well done is better than well said

Our chief defect is that we are more given to talking about things than to doing them

We have too many sounding words and too few actions that correspond with them

Activity in back of a very small idea will produce more than inactivity and the planning of a genius

When it comes to getting things done we need fewer architects and more bricklayers

Get good counsel before you begin and when you have decided act promptly

Ideas are one thing and what happens is another

Thinking about swimming isnt much like actually getting in the water Actually getting in the water can take your breath away

All worthwhile men have good thoughts good ideas and good intentions but precious few of them ever translate those into action

A thought which does not result in an action is nothing much and an action which does not proceed from a thought is nothing at all

To think is easy To act is difficult To act as one thinks is the most difficult of all

Unless a capacity for thinking be accompanied by a capacity for action a superior mind exists in torture

Contemplation often makes life miserable We should act more think less and stop watching ourselves live

What you theoretically know vividly realize

We must not waste life in devising means It is better to plan less and do more

The best way to prepare for life is to begin to live

We are always getting ready to live but never living

Action will remove the doubt that theory cannot solve

It is a common observation that those who dwell continually upon their expectations are apt to become oblivious to the requirements of their actual situation

He who deliberates fully before taking a step will spend his entire life on one leg

We dont have enough time to premeditate all our actions

The opportunity is often lost by deliberating

To think too long about doing a thing often becomes its undoing

Do not wait for ideal circumstances nor the best opportunities they will never come

Do what you can with what you have where you are

Anything worth doing is worth doing too soon

Now is the operative word Everything you put in your way is just a method of putting off the hour when you could actually be doing your dream

Common sense does not ask an impossible chessboard but takes the one before it and plays the game

I dont wait for moods You accomplish nothing if you do that Your mind must know it has got to get down to earth

My evil genius Procrastination has whispered me to tarry til a more convenient season

I realize that if I wait until I am no longer afraid to act write speak be Ill be sending messages on a ouija board cryptic complaints from the other side

He who postpones the hour of living is like the rustic who waits for the river to run out before he crosses

Being unready and illequipped is what you have to expect in life It is the universal predicament It is your lot as a human being to lack what it takes Circumstances are seldom right You never have the capacities the strength the wisdom the virtue you ought to have You must always do with less than you need in a situation vastly different from what you would have chosen

He who hesitates is last

Conditions are never just right People who delay action until all factors are favorable do nothing

You decide youll wait for your pitch Then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance And then you think about your swing And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch

So what do we do Anything Something So long as we just dont sit there If we screw it up start over Try something else If we wait until weve satisfied all the uncertainties it may be too late

Nothing at all will be attempted if all possible objections must first be overcome

No age or time of life no position or circumstance has a monopoly on success Any age is the right age to start doing

Everyone must row with the oars he has

The question for each man is not what he would do if he had the means time influence and educational advantages but what he will do with the things he has

How many opportunities come along If you wait for the right one thats wrong because it may never be right and what have you got to lose Even if its a disaster youve tried youve learned something youve had an adventure And that doesnt mean you cant do it again

And now Lord what wait I for

We should be taught not to wait for inspiration to start a thing Action always generates inspiration Inspiration seldom generates action

If you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street

The best place to succeed is where you are with what you have

One of these days is none of these days

Who waits until the wind shall silent keep Will never find the ready hour to sow

Begin somewhere you cannot build a reputation on what you intend to do

If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured it may never arrive Mountains will not be climbed races won or lasting happiness achieved

There is nothing to be gained by waiting for a better situation You see where you are and you do what you can with that

It is in your act that you exist not in your body Your act is yourself and there is no other you

The things people discard tell more about them than the things they keep

The test of any man lies in action

Every action we take everything we do is either a victory or defeat in the struggle to become what we want to be

Its where we go and what we do when we get there that tells us who we are

By his deeds we know a man

A human being has no discernible character until he acts

What we make is more important than what we are particularly if making is our profession

To do is to be

You cant build a reputation on what you intend to do

To be is to do

The way to do is to be

The ordinary man is involved in action the hero acts An immense difference

We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done

Our deeds determine us as much as we determine our deeds

The emotions are not always subject to reason but they are always subject to action When thoughts do not neutralize an undesirable emotion action will

Silences have a climax when you have got to speak

He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence

When I am idle and shiftless my affairs become confused when I work I get results not great results but enough to encourage me

To be busy with material affairs is the best preservative against reflection fears doubts all these things which stand in the way of achievement I suppose a fellow proposing to cut his throat would experience a sort of relief while occupied in stropping his razor carefully

Acting can work a peculiar magic on the actor it can cure you at least for the length of a performance of a whole variety of ailments Migraine headaches miserable colds or toothaches will suddenly disappear as youre up there going through your paces

It is only when I dally with what I am about look back and aside instead of keeping my eyes straight forward that I feel these cold sinkings of the heart But the first broadside puts all to rights

Action is the antidote to despair

Action is the only reality not only reality but morality as well

Performance releases pressure

Wishing does not make a poor man rich

You cant get rich sitting on the bench

Action makes more fortunes than caution

For purposes of action nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought combined with energy of will

How then find the courage for action By accepting the human condition more simply and candidly by dreading troubles less calculating less hoping more

Necessity of action takes away the fear of the act

Commitment leads to action Action brings your dream closer

One starts an action simply because one must do something

We couldnt possibly know where it would lead but we knew it had to be done

It is more blessed to give than to receive

You give but little when you give of your possessions It is when you give of yourself that you truly give

I make presents to the mother but think of the daughter

Give an inch hell take an ell

He gives twice who gives quickly

Or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone

Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind

I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts

Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity When I give I give myself

There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory

The paths of glory lead but to the grave

Mine eyes have seen the coming of the glory of the Lord

O how quickly passes away the glory of the earth

One crowded hour of glorious life Is worth an age without a name

God helps those who help themselves

Man proposes and God disposes

Gods in His Heaven Alls right with the world

Fear that man who fears not God

Nearer my God to Thee Nearer to Thee Een though it be a cross That raiseth me Still all my song shall be Nearer my God to Thee Nearer to Thee

I took a day to search for God And found Him not But as I trod By rocky ledge through woods untamed Just where one scarlet lily flamed I saw His foot print in the sod

A picket frozen on duty A mother starved for her brood Socrates drinking the hemlock And Jesus on the rood And millions who humble and nameless The straight hard pathway trod Some call it Consecration And others call it God

God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty

God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform He plants his footsteps in the sea And rides upon the storm

God is incorporeal divine supreme infinite Mind Spirit Soul Principle life Truth Love

An honest God is the noblest work of man

We trust Sir that God is on our side It is more important to know that we are on Gods side

A mighty fortress is our God A bulwark never failing Our helper he amid the flood Of mortal ills prevailing

Everyone is in a small way the image of God

What is it is man only a blunder of God or God only a blunder of man

A Godintoxicated man

He mounts the storm and walks upon the wind

The heavens declare the glory of God and the firmament showeth his handiwork

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still warm waters

God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble

There is no respect of persons with God

If God be for us who can be against us

The divine essence itself is love and wisdom

God the Great Giver can open the whole universe to our gaze in the narrow space of a single lane

Rock of Ages cleft for me Let me hide myself in thee

God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb

If there were no God it would be necessary to invent him

Give way to the Better if way to the Better there be It exacts a full look at the Worst

The significance of a man is not in what he attains but rather in what he longs to attain

Once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you in life I find

A successful individual typically sets his next goal somewhat but not too much above his last achievement In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration

The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success

All rising to great places is by a winding stair

The only thing to know is how to use your neuroses

Every ceiling when reached becomes a floor upon which one walks as a matter of course and prescriptive right

We can always redeem the man who aspires and strives

The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going

I have learned to have very modest goals for society and myself things like clean air green grass children with bright eyes not being pushed around useful work that suits ones abilities plain tasty food and occasional satisfying nookie

If you would hit the mark you must aim a little above it Every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth

Ah but a mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for

Before we set our hearts too much upon anything let us examine how happy they are who already possess it

Ours is a world where people dont know what they want and are willing to go through hell to get it

Accept the place the divine providence has found for you the society of your contemporaries the connection of events

Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly

It is a mistake to look too far ahead Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time

Do not wish to be anything but what you are and try to be that perfectly

This one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark

Winning isnt everything but wanting to win is

It is no longer clear which way is up even if one wants to rise

Ambition is pitiless Any merit that it cannot use it finds despicable

Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition

Well is it known that ambition can creep as well as soar

Make no little plans they have no magic to stir mens blood Make big plans aim high in hope and work

An aim in life is the only fortune worth finding

You have to have a dream so you can get up in the morning

What an immense power over the life is the power of possessing distinct aims The voice the dress the look the very motions of a person define and alter when he or she begins to live for a reason

If I had one wish for my children it would be that each of them would reach for goals that have meaning for them as individuals

The tragedy of life doesnt lie in not reaching your goal The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach

Purpose is what gives life a meaning

Nothing contributes so much to tranquilize the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye

The poor man is not he who is without a cent but he who is without a dream

He is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment when he is consumed in the service of an idea in the conquest of the goal pursued

He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how

The great and glorious masterpiece of man is to know how to live to purpose

Great minds have purposes others have wishes

Unless you give yourself to some great cause you havent even begun to live

If we could only give just once the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks vacation we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days

Be a life long or short its completeness depends on what it was lived for

To live means to have a mission to fulfilland in the measure in which we avoid setting our life to something we make it empty

To seek ones goals and to drive toward it steeling ones heart is most uplifting

The true worth of a man is to be measured by the objects he pursues

A useless life is an early death

My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard Mother would come out and say Youre tearing up the grass Were not raising grass Dad would reply Were raising boys

Without a purpose nothing should be done

To grow and know what one is growing towardsthat is the source of all strength and confidence in life

Our plans miscarry because they have no aim When a man does not know what harbor he is making for no wind is the right wind

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

Men cannot for long live hopefully unless they are embarked upon some great unifying enterprise one for which they may pledge their lives their fortunes and their honor

No pleasure philosophy no sensuality no place nor power no material success can for a moment give such inner satisfaction as the sense of living for good purpose

Many are stubborn in pursuit of the path they have chosen few in pursuit of the goal

There is one thing which gives radiance to everything It is the idea of something around the corner

Lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have

There are three ingredients in the good life learning earning and yearning

If you cry Forward you must make plain in what direction to go

Men like nails lose their usefulness when they lose direction and begin to bend

A novelist must know what his last chapter is going to say and one way or another work toward that last chapter To me it is utterly basic yet it seems like its a great secret

Obstacles are those frightful things you see when you take your eyes off the goal

You must have longrange goals to keep you from being frustrated by shortrange failures

The world stands aside to let anyone pass who knows where he is going

This is true joy of lifethe being used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a right one instead of being a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy

Not only must we be good but we must also be good for something

It is when things go hardest when life becomes most trying that there is greatest need for having a fixed goal When few comforts come from without it is all the more necessary to have a fount to draw on from within

In everything one must consider the end

A straight path never leads anywhere except to the objective

Theres some end at last for the man who follows a path mere rambling is interminable

Having a goal is a state of happiness

The American people can have anything they want the trouble is they dont know what they want

Life has a meaning only if one barters it day by day for something other than itself

To have a reason to get up in the morning it is necessary to possess a guiding principle A belief of some kind A bumper sticker if you will

An aspiration is a joy forever a possession as solid as a landed estate a fortune which we can never exhaust and which gives us year by year a revenue of pleasurable activity

The soul that has no established aim loses itself

Life has a value only when it has something valuable as its object

He turns not back who is bound to a star

He might never really do what he said but at least he had it in mind He had somewhere to go

The great and glorious masterpiece of man is how to live with a purpose

What most counts is not to live but to live aright

Choosing a goal and sticking to it changes everything

No wind serves him who addresses his voyage to no certain port

Laboring toward distant aims sets the mind in a higher key and puts us at our best

Everythings in the mind Thats where it all starts Knowing what you want is the first step toward getting it

Set short term goals and youll win games Set long term goals and youll win championships

We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life when all that we need to make us really happy is something to be enthusiastic about

Unhappiness is in not knowing what we want and killing ourselves to get it

Having a dream isnt stupid Its not having a dream thats stupid

Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal

To have no set purpose in ones life is the harlotry of the will

There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something

Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes

One of the sources of pride in being a human being is the ability to bear present frustrations in the interests of longer purposes

Only he who can see the invisible can do the impossible

If you dont know where you are going how can you expect to get there

The only people who attain power are those who crave for it

Destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved

In this life we get only those things for which we hunt for which we strive and for which we are willing to sacrifice

You seldom get what you go after unless you know in advance what you want

Where no plan is laid where the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident chaos will soon reign

A life that hasnt a definite plan is likely to become driftwood

Only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road

Fortunate is the person who has developed the selfcontrol to steer a straight course toward his objective in life without being swayed from his purpose by either commendation or condemnation

Nothing is more terrible than activity without insight

If we would only give just once the same amount of reflection to what we want to get out of life that we give to the question of what to do with a two weeks vacation we would be startled at our false standards and the aimless procession of our busy days

The purpose of life is a life of purpose

Aim at nothing and youll succeed

The purpose of life is life

Goals are dreams with deadlines

So long as I believe I have to do certain things I will just go right ahead Thats how I run my life

A schedule defends from chaos and whim It is a net for catching days It is a scaffolding on which a worker can stand and labor with both hands at sections of time

You decide what it is you want to accomplish and then you lay out your plans to get there and then you just do it Its pretty straightforward

What does socalled success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do The doing is all that really counts

Get out of the blocks run your race stay relaxed If you run your race youll win Channel your energy Focus

Know what you want to dothen do it Make straight for your goal and go undefeated in spirit to the end

There is a place in Gods sun for the youth farthest down who has the vision the determination and the courage to reach it

Every man is said to have his peculiar ambition

We all live with the objective of being happy our lives are all different and yet the same

Follow your bliss Find where it is and dont be afraid to follow it

You cant assume the responsibility for everything you door dont do

There were angry men confronting me and I caught the flashing of defiant eyes but above me and within me there was a spirit stronger than them all

A woman finds the natural lay of the land almost unconsciously and not feeling it incumbent on her to be guide and philosopher to any successor she takes little pains to mark the route by which she is making her ascent

No matter what the competition is I try to find a goal that day and better that goal

It doesnt matter what anybody thinks of what I do The clock doesnt lie

You can have your titular recognition Ill take money and power

Normal is not something to aspire to its something to get away from

Im always making a comeback but nobody ever tells me where Ive been

My passions were all gathered together like fingers that made a fist Drive is considered aggression today I knew it then as purpose

In the multitude of middleaged men who go about their vocations in a daily course determined for them much in the same way as they tie their cravats there is always a good number who once meant to shape their own deeds and alter the world a little

Remember if people talk behind your back it only means youre two steps ahead

Its a sign of your own worth sometimes if you are hated by the right people

For me its the challengethe challenge to try to beat myself or do better than I did in the past I try to keep in mind not what I have accomplished but what I have to try to accomplish in the future

Theres a very fine line between a groove and a rut a fine line between eccentrics and people who are just plain nuts

Promises that you make to yourself are often like the Japanese plum treethey bear no fruit

I am not sending messages with my feet All I ever wanted was not to come up empty I did it for the dough and the old applause

First say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do

I can honestly say that I was never affected by the question of the success of an undertaking If I felt it was the right thing to do I was for it regardless of the possible outcome

What exactly is success For me it is to be found not in applause but in the satisfaction of feeling that one is realizing ones ideal

We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough What do you want most to do Thats what I have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties

To be what we are and to become what we are capable of becoming is the only end of life

You have to define success in your own way What maintains your dignity and integrity and what is your lifes plan where do you want to put your efforts I could be richer and more famous but I would have to give up things that are of infinitely more value

You cannot do good work if you take your mind off the work to see how the community is taking it

When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning it satisfies the senses amazingly

Our victory is sure to come and I can endure anything but recreancy to principle

If you just set out to be liked you would be prepared to compromise on anything at any time and you would achieve nothing

Concentrate on finding your goal then concentrate on reaching it

Enthusiasm for ones goal lessens the disagreeableness of working toward it

Im not going to let my life revolve around losing weight I have other things to do

The streams which would otherwise diverge to fertilize a thousand meadows must be directed into one deep narrow channel before they can turn a mill

He who wants to do everything will never do anything

As you emphasize your life you must localize and define it you cannot do everything

There are people who want to be everywhere at once and they get nowhere

Leader and followers are both following the invisible leaderthe common purpose

A windmill is eternally at work to accomplish one end although it shifts with every variation of the weathercock and assumes ten different positions in a day

People can have many different kinds of pleasure The real one is that for which they will forsake the others

Nations like individuals have to limit their objectives or take the consequences

One of the most important factors not only in military matters but in life as a whole is the ability to direct ones whole energies towards the fulfillment of a particular task

It is in selflimitation that a master first shows himself

One cannot manage too many affairs like pumpkins in the water one pops up while you try to hold down the other

One principle reason why men are so often useless is that they divide and shift their attention among a multitude of objects and pursuits

I can tell you how to get what you want Youve just got to keep a thing in view and go for it and never let your eyes wander to right or left or up or down And looking back is fatal

He who begins many things finishes but few

Who begins too much accomplishes little

Never try to catch two frogs with one hand

If you run after two hares you will catch neither

The greyhound that starts many hares kills none

A bull does not enjoy fame in two herds

The man who seeks one thing in life and but one May hope to achieve it before life be done But he who seeks all things wherever he goes Only reaps from the hopes which around him he sows A harvest of barren regrets

Those who attain any excellence commonly spend life in one pursuit for excellence is not often granted upon easier terms Samuel Johnson No man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other

He who wishes to fulfill his mission in the world must be a man of one idea one great overmastering purpose overshadowing all his aims and guiding and controlling his entire life

Firmness of purpose is one of the most necessary sinews of character and one of the best instruments of success Without it genius wastes its efforts in a maze of inconsistencies

A doubleminded man is unstable in all his ways A determinate purpose in life and a steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages are indispensable conditions of success

If you would be Pope you must think of nothing else

One should want only one thing and want it constantly Then one is sure of getting it But I desire everything and consequently get nothing

I care not what your education is elaborate or nothing what your mental calibre is great or small that man who concentrates all his energies of body mind and soul in one direction is a tremendous man

He who hunts two hares leaves one and loses the other

He who serves two masters has to lie to one

All animals except man know that the ultimate of life is to enjoy it

What does socalled success or failure matter if only you have succeeded in doing the thing you set out to do The doing is all that really counts

Catching something is purely a byproduct of our fishing It is the act of fishing that wipes away all grief lightens all worry dissolves all fear and anxiety

Let us live while we are alive

Life is an end in itself and the only question as to whether it is worth living is whether you have had enough of it

I take it as a prime cause of the present confusion of society that it is too sickly and too doubtful to use pleasure as a test of value

There is no cure for birth and death save to enjoy the interval

Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time

All men seek one goal success or happiness

The goal of all civilization all religious thought and all that sort of thing is simply to have a good time But man gets so solemn over the process that he forgets the end

The business of life is to enjoy oneself everything else is a mockery

The true object of human life is play

Use your health even to the point of wearing it out That is what it is for Spend all you have before you die do not outlive yourself

Pleasure is the object duty and the goal of all rational creatures

Pleasure is the only thing to live for Nothing ages like happiness

I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it

Life exists for the love of music or beautiful things

There is only one meaning of life the act of living itself

The main obligation is to amuse yourself

From his cradle to the grave a man never does a single thing which has any first and foremost object save oneto secure peace of mind spiritual comfort for himself

I take it that what all men are really after is some form of perhaps only some formula of peace

There is no such thing as expecting too much

Your goal should be out of reach but not out of sight

Why should I deem myself to be a chisel when I could be the artist

Ive always had such high expectations for myself Im aware of them but I cant relax them

I want to be great or nothing I wont be a commonplace dauber so I dont intend to try any more

Were half the people we should be half the Congress

I think the key is for women not to set any limits

Its expectation that differentiates you from the dead

The state of the world today demands that women become less modest and dreamplanactrisk on a larger scale

Aim at the sun and you may not reach it but your arrow will fly far higher than if aimed at an object on a level with yourself

When one paints an ideal one does not need to limit ones imagination

If you would hit the mark you must aim a little above it every arrow that flies feels the attraction of earth

People dont pay much attention to you when you are second best I wanted to see what it felt like to be number one

Nearly every glamorous wealthy successful career woman you might envy now started out as some kind of schlepp

The fact that I was a girl never damaged my ambitions to be a pope or an emperor

In the long run men hit only what they aim at Therefore though they should fall immediately they had better aim at something high

Each time I leaped I seemed to touch the sky and when I regained earth it seemed to be mine alone

The tragedy of life doesnt lie in not reaching your goal The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach It isnt a calamity to die with dreams unfulfilled but it is a calamity not to dream It is not disgrace to reach the stars but it is a disgrace to have no stars to reach for Not failure but low aim is a sin

I have an almost complete disregard of precedent and a faith in the possibility of something better It irritates me to be told how things always have been done I defy the tyranny of precedent I cannot afford the luxury of a closed mind I go for anything new that might improve the past

Its not enough to just swing at the ball Youve got to loosen your girdle and really let it fly

I am comforted by lifes stability by earths unchangeableness What has seemed new and frightening assumes its place in the unfolding of knowledge

Someday someone will follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the Presidents spouse And I wish him well

The most absurd and reckless aspirations have sometimes led to extraordinary success

When you reach for the stars you may not quite get one but you wont come up with a handful of mud either

I might have been born in a hovel but I am determined to travel with the wind and the stars

The brain is wider than the sky

My motto sans limites

A lot of young girls have looked to their career paths and have said theyd like to be chief Theres been a change in the limits people see

My father said Dont grow up to be a woman and what he meant by that was a housewife without any interests

Our being is subject to all the chances of life There are so many things we are capable of that we could be or do The potentialities are so great that we never any of us are more than onefourth fulfilled

What else are we gonna live by if not dreams We need to believe in something What would really drive us crazy is to believe this reality we run into every day is all there is If I dont believe that theres a happy ending out therethat willyoumarryme in the skyI cant keep working today

People think that at the top there isnt much room They tend to think of it as an Everest My message is that there is tons of room at the top

I am always more interested in what I am about to do than in what I have already done

We have believedand we do believe nowthat freedom is indivisible that peace is indivisible that economic prosperity is indivisible

I always ask the question Is this what I want in my life

Tell them that as soon as I can walk Im going to fly

He who demands little gets it

Unless in one thing or another we are straining toward perfection we have forfeited our manhood

It is necessary to try to surpass ones self always this occupation ought to last as long as life

I was born to be a remarkable woman it matters little in what way or how I shall be famous or I will die

I never intended to become a runofthemill person

There is only one real sin and that is to persuade oneself that the second best is anything but second best

Too low they build who build beneath the stars

I have the same goal Ive had ever since I was a little girl I want to rule the world

Your world is as big as you make it

Whatever course you have chosen for yourself it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre

Once you say youre going to settle for second thats what happens to you

Aim at heaven and you get earth thrown in aim at earth and you get neither

I truly believe that before I retire from public office Ill be voting for a woman for president

We are all in the gutter but some of us are looking at the stars

If I smashed the traditions it was because I knew no traditions

Aim at perfection in everything though in most things it is unattainable However they who aim at it and persevere will come much nearer to it than those whose laziness and despondency make them give it up as unattainable

One may miss the mark by aiming too high as too low

Shoot for the moon Even if you miss it you will land among the stars

We aim above the mark to hit the mark Every act hath some falsehood or exaggeration in it

Life is a petty thing unless it is moved by the indomitable urge to extend its boundaries

Far away in the sunshine are my highest inspirations I many not reach them but I can look up and see the beauty believe in them and try to follow where they lead

A mans worth is no greater than the worth of his ambitions

Not failure but low aim is crime

On the human chessboard all moves are possible

Great is the road I climb but the garland offered by an easier effort is not worth the gathering

I never took a position we were going to be a good ball club I took the position we were going to be a winning ball club

Mans reach should exceed his grasp or whats a heaven for

Before you begin a thing remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin

You have to erect a fence and say Okay scale this

You can change your beliefs so they empower your dreams and desires Create a strong belief in yourself and what you want

Man can only receive what he sees himself receiving

A person can grow only as much as his horizon allows

You must learn day by day year by year to broaden your horizon The more things you love the more you are interested in the more you enjoy the more you are indignant about the more you have left when anything happens

Enjoyment is not a goal it is a feeling that accompanies important ongoing activity

What our deepest self craves is not mere enjoyment but some supreme purpose that will enlist all our powers and give unity and direction to our life

The very first condition of lasting happiness is that a life should be full of purpose aiming at something outside self

The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose

There is more to life than just existing and having a pleasant time

Happiness is not the end of life character is

Many persons have a wrong idea of what constitutes true happiness It is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose

A good goal is like a strenuous exerciseit makes you stretch

Its weak and despicable to go on wanting things and not trying to get them

Growth is not concerned with itself

The selfconfidence one builds from achieving difficult things and accomplishing goals is the most beautiful thing of all

If ambition doesnt hurt you you havent got it

We need to restore the full meaning of that old word duty It is the other side of rights

This is true joy of lifebeing used for a purpose that is recognized by yourself as a mighty one instead of being a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy

That is happiness to be dissolved into something completely great

I looked on child rearing not only as a work of love and duty but as a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession in the world and one that demanded the best I could bring to it

Human happiness and moral duty are inseparably connected

The measure of a life after all is not its duration but its donation

When we devote ourselves to the strict and unsparing performance of duty ihen happiness comes of itself

Duties are what make life most worth living Lacking them you are not necessary to anyone

Seek happiness for its own sake and you will not find it seek for duty and happiness will follow as the shadow comes with the sunshine

True happiness is not attained through selfgratification but through fidelity to a worthy purpose

The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose

True happiness we are told consists in getting out of ones self but the point is not only to get out you must stay out and to stay out you must have some absorbing errand

Happiness is the natural flower of duty

The happiest excitement in life is to be convinced that one is fighting for all one is worth on behalf of some clearly seen and deeply felt good

The secret of living is to find the pivot of a concept on which you can make your stand

The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who will have sought and found how to serve

He who never sacrificed a present to a future good or a personal to a general one can speak of happiness only as the blind speak of color

There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something

The fullgrown modern human being is conscious of touching the highest pinnacle of fulfillment when he is consumed in the service of an idea in the conquest of the goal pursued

Happiness is essentially a state of going somewhere wholeheartedly onedirectionally without regret or reservation

A mans happiness to do the things proper to man

Happy the man who knows his duties

I believe half the unhappiness in life comes from people being afraid to go straight at things

Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal

Give a man health and a course to steer and hell never stop to trouble about whether hes happy or not

Having a goal is a state of happiness

Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort

Without duty life is soft and boneless

Never mind your happiness do your duty

I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who by all laws of logic should never have made it At each stage of my career I lacked the experience

The man who succeeds above his fellows is the one who early in life discerns his object and toward that object habitually directs his powers Even genius itself is but fine observation strengthened by fixity of purpose

If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours

A determinate purpose of life and steady adhesion to it through all disadvantages are indispensable conditions of success

The secret of success is constancy to purpose

The man who fails because he aims astray or because he does not aim at all is to be found everywhere

Life has taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors She taught me to seek sustenance from the endeavor itself but to leave the result to God

The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his

The object of war is to survive it

If we want a free and peaceful world if we want to make the deserts bloom and man grow to greater dignity as a human beingwe can do it

The most comprehensive formulation of therapeutic goals is the striving for wholeheartedness to be without pretense to be emotionally sincere to be able to put the whole of oneself into ones feelings ones work ones beliefs

I think the purpose of life is to be useful to be responsible to be honorable to be compassionate It is after all to matter to count to stand for something to have made some difference that you lived at all

Only when men are connected to large universal goals are they really happyand one result of their happiness is a rush of creative activity

The great business of life is to be to do to do without and to depart

The proper function of man is to livenot to exist

Lifes objective is life itself

I seek the utmost pleasure and the least pain

There are two things to aim at in life first to get what you want and after that to enjoy it Only the wisest of mankind achieve the second

I am searching for that which every man seekspeace and rest

Reach high for stars lie hidden in your soul Dream deep for every dream precedes the goal

Never undertake anything for which you wouldnt have the courage to ask the blessings of heaven

The one thing worth living for is to keep ones soul pure

The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it

How to make God laugh Tell him your future plans

God enters by a private door into every individual

God gives the milk but not the pail

God Himself is not secure having given man dominion over His work

God is a circle whose centre is everywhere and circumference nowhere

God is not dead but alive and well and working on a much less ambitious project

God pays but not weekly wages

God seems to have the receiver off the hook

God uses lust to impel men to marry ambition to office avarice to earning and fear to faith God led me like an old blind goat

God will provide if only God would provide until he provides

God when he makes the prophet does not unmake the man

He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust

I wouldnt put it past God to arrange a virgin birth if he wanted to but I very much doubt if he would because it seems to be contrary to the way in which he deals with persons and brings his wonders out of natural personal relationships

If Jesus was Jewish how come he has a Mexican name

In the faces of men and women I see God and in my own face in the glass I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is signed by Gods name and I leave them where they are for I know that wheresoever I go others will punctually come for ever and ever

The glory of God is in man fully alive

The Vatican is against surrogate mothers Good thing they didnt have that rule when Jesus was born

The worst that you can say about him God is that basically hes an underachiever

Though the mills of God grind slowly yet they grind exceeding small Though with patience He stands waiting with exactness grinds he all

Try thyself first and after call in God For to the worker God himself lends aid

By night an atheist halfbelieves in God

Father expected a good deal of God He didnt actually accuse God of inefficiency but when he prayed his tone was loud and angry like that of a dissatisfied guest in a carelessly managed hotel

Lord who art always the same give that I know myself give that I know Thee

We have no choice but to be guilty God is unthinkable if we are innocent

Man appoints and God disappoints

I am afraid I shall not find Him but I shall still look for Him If He exists He may be appreciative of my efforts

God is not a cosmic bellboy for whom we can press a button to get things done

God is usually on the side of big squadrons and against little ones

The more of himself man attributes to God the less he has left in himself

God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb

God is a comedian whose audience is afraid to laugh

Every man thinks God is on his side The rich and powerful know he is

I could prove God statistically

Man is a dogs ideal of what God should be

Christ an anarchist who succeeded

An honest God is the noblest work of man

It is left only to God and to the angels to be lookers on

God is really another artist He invented the giraffe the elephant and the cat He has no real style He just goes on trying other things

The nearer the church the further from God

Godll send the bill to you

I believe there is no god but Allah alone and Muhammed is his prophet

The world is more exacting than God himself

Give God time

God will be present whether asked or not

If God did not exist it would be necessary to invent him

We trust sir that God is on our side It is more important to know that we are on Gods side

The abdomen is the reason why man does not easily take himself for a god

Beware of the man whose God is in the skies

I cant believe that God plays dice with the universe

One on Gods side is a majority

If triangles had a God he would have three sides

God does not pay weekly but he pays at the end

The finding of God is the coming to ones own self

God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform He plants his footsteps in the sea And rides upon the storm

Man proposes God disposes

God doth not need Either mans work or his own gifts who best Bear His mild yoke they serve Him best His state Is kingly thousands at His bidding speed And post oer land and ocean without rest They also serve who only stand and wait

If God made us in his image we have certainly returned the compliment

God does not die on the day when we cease to believe in a personal deity but we die on the day when our lives cease to be illuminated by the steady radiance renewed daily of a wonder the source of which is beyond all reason

We know only that we are living in these bodies and have a vague idea because we have heard it and because our faith tells us so that we possess souls As to what good qualities there may be in our souls or who dwells within them or how precious they are those are things which we seldom consider and so we trouble little about carefully preserving the souls beauty

I believe in the incomprehensibility of God

Every conjecture we can form with regard to the works of God has as little probability as the conjectures of a child with regard to the works of a man

God is incorporeal divine supreme infinite Mind Spirit Soul Principle Life Truth Love

No statement about God is simply literally true God is far more than can be measured described defined in ordinary language or pinned down to any particular happening

Who fathoms the Eternal Thought Who talks of scheme and plan The Lord is God He needeth not The poor device of man

Some people want to see God with their eyes as they see a cow and to love Him as they love their cowfor the milk and cheese and profit it brings them This is how it is with people who love God for the sake of outward wealth or inward comfort

Your mind cannot possibly understand God Your heart already knows Minds were designed for carrying out the orders of the heart

A comprehended God is no God at all

What do you think of God the teacher asked After a pause the young pupil replied Hes not a think hes a feel

To them that ask where have you seen the Gods or how do you know for certain there are Gods that you are so devout in their worship I answer Neither have I ever seen my own soul and yet I respect and honor it

It is the heart which experiences God not the reason

I always say my God will take care of me If its my time Ill go and if its not I wont I feel that He really has a lot of important things for me to do And Hes going to make sure that Im here to do them

God is like a mirror The mirror never changes but everybody who looks at it sees something different

God is to me that creative Force behind and in the universe who manifests Himself as energy as life as order as beauty as thought as conscience as love

God is incorporeal divine supreme infinite Mind Spirit Soul Principle Life Truth Love

God that dumping ground of our dreams

The God of many men is little more than their court of appeal against the damnatory judgement passed on their failures by the opinion of the world

God to be God must transcend what is He must be the maker of what ought to be

God is an unutterable sigh planted in the depths of the soul

God is a verb not a noun

The most beautiful of all emblems is that of God whom Timaeus of Locris describes under the image of A circle whose centre is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere

God is what man finds that is divine in himself God is the best way man can behave in the ordinary occasions of life and the farthest point to which man can stretch himself

The deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe forms my idea of God

God has many names though He is only one Being

There is but one ultimate Power This Power is to each one what he is to it

It is impossible to fulfill the law concerning love for Me God eternal apart from the law concerning love for your neighbors

When we lose God it is not God who is lost

If were not growing we must feel guilty because we are not fulfilling Christs demand

The soul can split the sky in two and let the face of God shine through

God enters by a private door into every individual

The best thing must be to flee from all to the All

A humble knowledge of oneself is a surer road to God than a deep searching of the sciences

By learning to contact listen to and act on our intuition we can directly connect to the higher power of the universe and allow it to become our guiding force

Its only by forgetting yourself that you draw near to God

Some people talk about finding God as if He could get lost

Hunting God is a great adventure

In the faces of men and women I see God

To Be is to live with God

Nothing hath separated us from God but our own will or rather our own will is our separation from God

The kingdom of God is within you

Not only then has each man his individual relation to God but each man has his peculiar relation to God

Because you cannot see him God is everywhere

All who call on God in true faith earnestly from the heart will certainly be heard and will receive what they have asked and desired

The light of God surrounds me The love of God enfolds me The power of God protects me The Presence of God watches over me Wherever I am God is

To think you are separate from God is to remain separate from your own being

So great was my joy in God that I took no heed of looking at the angels and the saints because all their goodness and all their beauty was from Him and in Him

Our condition is most noble being so beloved of the Most High God that He was willing to die for our sake which He would not have done if man had not been a most noble creature and of great worth

Our perfection certainly consists in knowing God and ourselves

In every outthrust headland in every curving beach in every grain of sand there is the story of the earth

Fo those leaning on the sustaining infinite today is big with blessings

Oh if everyone knew how beautiful Jesus is how amiable He is Fhey would all die from love

He loves He hopes He waits Our Lord prefers to wait Himself for the sinner for years rather than keep us waiting an instant

Fhe Creator and Lord of all so loved the world that He sent His Son for its salvation the Prince and Savior of the faithful who washed and dried our wounds and from Him also came that most sweet medicine from which all the good things of salvation flow

Sometimes I try my hand at turning out small profundities and uncertain short stories but I always end up with just one single word God

Eventually I lost interest in trying to control my life to make things happen in a way that I thought I wanted them to be I began to practice surrendering to the universe and finding out what it wanted me to do

I would rather walk with God in the dark than go alone in the light

Without the assistance of the Divine Being I cannot succeed With that assistance I cannot fail

For the rest of my life Im going to trust that God is always at work in all things and give Him thanks long before my simplest prayers are answered

Divine love always has met and always will meet every human need

Jesus makes the bitterest mouthful taste sweet

The best remedy for those who are afraid lonely or unhappy is to go outside somewhere where they can be quiet alone with the heavens nature and God Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy amidst the simple beauty of nature As long as this exists and it certainly always will I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow whatever the circumstances may be And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles

Whoever falls from Gods right hand is caught into His left

If I saw the gates of hell open and I stood on the brink of the abyss I would not despair I would not lose hope of mercy because I would trust in You my God

The accidents of life separate us from our dearest friends but let us not despair God is like a looking glass in which souls see each other The more we are united to Him by love the nearer we are to those who belong to Him

The things which are impossible with men are possible with God

I will not fear for you are ever with me and you will never leave me to face my perils alone

Pardon not wrath is Gods best attribute

Walk boldly and wisely There is a hand above that will help you on

For the multitude of worldly friends profiteth not nor may strong helpers anything avail nor wise counselors give profitable counsel nor the cunning of doctors give consolation nor riches deliver in time of need nor a secret place to defend if Thou Lord do not assist help comfort counsel inform and defend

The Blessed Virgin used me like a broom and then put me back in my place

Many a humble soul will be amazed to find that the seed it sowed in weakness in the dust of daily life has blossomed into immortal flowers under the eye of the Lord

Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths

God speaks to all individuals through what happens to them moment by moment

God uses lust to impel men to marry ambition to office avarice to earning and fear to faith God led me like an old blind goat

An act of God was defined as something which no reasonable man could have expected

Let God love you through others and let God love others through you

My debt to you Beloved Is one I cannot pay In any coin of any realm On any reckoning day

One unquestioned text we read All doubt beyond all fear above Nor crackling pile nor cursing creed Can burn or blot it God is Love

A true love of God must begin with a delight in his holiness

As to the aridity you are suffering from it seems to me our Lord is treating you like someone He considers strong He wants to test you and see if you love Him as much at times of aridity as when He sends you consolations I think this is a very great favor for God to show you

The first condition of human goodness is something to love the second something to revere

No man hates God without first hating himself

How is it Lord that we are cowards in everything save in opposing thee

I have never understood why it should be considered derogatory to the Creator to suppose that He has a sense of humor

Every law of matter or the body supposed to govern manis rendered null and void by the law of Life God

Whom the heart of man shuts out Sometimes the heart of God takes in

I need nothing but God and to lose myself in the heart of God

To love one that is great is almost to be great ones self

I would rather walk with God in the dark than go alone in the light

What we are is Gods gift to us What we become is our gift to God

Gawd knows and E wont split on a pal

Holy churchthat mother who is also a queen because she is a kings bride

You are accepted accepted by that which is greater than you and the name of which you do not know Do not ask the name now perhaps you will know it later Do not try to do anything perhaps later you will do much Do not seek for anything do not perform anything do not intend anything Simply accept the fact that you are accepted

As in heaven Your will is punctually performed so may it be done on earth by all creatures particularly in me and by me

Christ has made my soul beautiful with the jewels of grace and virtue

God delays but doesnt forget

How is it Lord that we are cowards in everything save in opposing Thee

God is clever but not dishonest

Yet in the maddening maze of things And tossed by storm and flood To one fixed trust my spirit clings I know that God is good

The million little things that drop into your hands The small opportunities each day brings He leaves us free to use or abuse And goes unchanging along His silent way

The Father most tender Father of all my immense GodI His atom

What is there in man so worthy of honor and reverence as this that he is capable of contemplating something higher than his own reason more sublime than the whole universe that Spirit which alone is selfsubsistent from which all truth proceeds without which there is no truth

I thank the goodness and the grace Which on my birth have smiled And made me in these Christian days A happy Christian child

A consciousness of God releases the greatest power of all

Above all am I convinced of the need irrevocable and inescapable of every human heart for God No matter how we try to escape to lose ourselves in restless seeking we cannot separate ourselves from our divine source There is no substitute for God

Talking about God is not at all the same thing as experiencing God or acting out God through our lives

The person who has a firm trust in the Supreme Being is powerful in his power wise by his wisdom happy by his happiness

God has not promised skies always blue flowerstrewn pathways all our lives through God has not promised sun without rain joy without sorrow peace without pain But God has promised strength for the day rest for the labor light for the way Grace for the trials help from above unfailing sympathy undying love

Courage is not afraid to weep and she is not afraid to pray even when she is not sure who she is praying to

God is no enemy to you He asks no more than that He hear you call Him Friend

Deep down in every man woman and child is the fundamental idea of God It may be obscured by calamity by pomp by worship of other things but in some form or other it is there For faith in a Power greater than ourselves and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives are facts as old as man himself

Our human resources as marshalled by the will were not sufficient they failed utterly Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of Gods will into all our activities

Then comes the insight that All is God One still realizes that the world is as it was but it does not matter it does not affect ones faith

The experience of God or in any case the possibility of experiencing God is innate

Before me even as behind God is and all is well

Forgetfulness of self is remembrance of God

Every morning I spend fifteen minutes filling my mind full of God and so theres no room left for worry thoughts

Darkness is strong and so is Sin But surely God endures forever

It is not my ability but my response to Gods ability that counts

Do unto the other feller the way hed like to do unto you an do it fust

Whatsoever thou wouldst that men should not do to thee do not do that to them

We have committed the Golden Rule to memory let us now commit it to life

Behold I do not give lectures on a little charity When I give I give myself

If a friend is in trouble dont annoy him by asking if there is anything you can do Think up something appropriate and do it

The greatest pleasure I know is to do a good action by stealth and to have it found out by accident

As Charles Lamb says there is nothing so nice as doing good by stealth and being found out by accident so I now say it is even nicer to make heroic decisions and to be prevented by circumstances beyond your control from ever trying to execute them

Giving is the highest expression of potency

If I knew that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good I should run for my life

If Ive learned anything in my seventy years its that nothings as good or as bad as it appears

The Devil himself is good when he is pleased

Wise men appreciate all men for they see the good in each and know how hard it is to make anything good

The only gift is a portion of thyself

Take egotism out and you would castrate the benefactor

It is one of the beautiful compensations of this life that no one can sincerely try to help another without helping himself

No man deserves to be praised for his goodness unless he has the strength of character to be wicked All other goodness is generally nothing but indolence or impotence of will

We know the good we apprehend it clearly But we cant bring it to achievement

Generosity is the vanity of giving

My only policy is to profess evil and do good

Biography is higher gossip

Even doubtful accusations leave a stain behind them

Leonard Woolf in a letter to Lytton Strachey said he hated John Maynard Keynes for his crass stupidity and hideous face

No one gossips about other peoples secret virtues

Gossip is when you hear something you like about someone you dont

Gossip needs no carriage

Another good thing about gossip is that it is within everybodys reach And it is much more interesting than any other form of speech

Hating anything in the way of illnatured gossip ourselves we are always grateful to those who do it for us and do it well

No gossip ever dies away entirely if many people voice it it too is a kind of divinity

Gossip is vice enjoyed vicariously the sweet subtle satisfaction without the risk

The glory that was Greece

He who is greedy is always in want

No gain satisfies a greedy mind

Ambition if it feeds at all does so on the ambition of others

You can stand tall without standing on someone You can be a victor without having victims

Greed lessens what is gathered

We risk all in being too greedy

Greed is a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction

Greed like the love of comfort is a kind of fear

Pillars are fallen at thy feet Fanes quiver in the air A prostrate city is thy seat And thou alone art there

On what strange stuff Ambition feeds

The greedy man is incontent with a whole world set before him

For greed all nature is too little

Greeds worst point is its ingratitude

It is foolish to tear ones hair in grief as though sorrow would be made less by baldness

There is no grief which time does not lessen and soften

Grief is itself a medcine

The only cure for grief is action

Heavy hearts like heavy clouds in the sky are best relieved by the letting of water

Every one can master a grief but he that has it

Whats gone and whats past help Should be past grief

A precedent embalms a principle

Contemporary man has rationalized the myths but he has not been able to destroy them

Custom is second nature and no less powerful

Custom reconciles us to everything

Few people have ever seriously wished to be exclusively rational The good life which most desire is a life warmed by passions and touched with that ceremonial grace which is impossible without some affectionate loyalty to traditional forms and ceremonies

Habit is a great deadener

Habit is habit and not to be thrown out of the window by any man but coaxed downstairs a step at a time

Have a place for everything and keep the things somewheres else That is not advice it is merely custom

He who does anything because it is the custom makes no choice

In some remote regions of Islam it is said a woman caught unveiled by a stranger will raise her skirt to cover her face

Innumerable are the illusions and legerdemain tricks of custom but of all these perhaps the cleverest is her knack of persuading us that the miraculous by simple repetition ceases to be miraculous

It is well to lie fallow for a while

She always says she dislikes the abnormal it is so obvious She says the normal is so much more simply complicated and interesting

The despotism of custom is everywhere standing up to human advancement

The way of the world is to praise dead saints and persecute living ones

There is nothing sacred about convention there is nothing sacred about primitive passions or whims but the fact that a convention exists indicates that a way of living has been devised capable of maintaining itself

Tradition does not mean that the living are dead it means that the dead are living

Tradition is a guide and not a jailer

Custom that unwritten law By which the people keep even kings in awe

Habit is stronger than reason

Laws are never as effective as habits

Habituation is a falling asleep or fatiguing of the sense of time which explains why young years pass slowly while later life flings itself faster and faster upon its course

The gnarled fidelity of an old habit

Habit is the enormous flywheel of society its most precious conservative agent There is no more miserable human being than one in whom nothing is habitual but indecision Full half the time of such a man goes to the deciding or regretting of matters which ought to be so ingrained in him as practically not to exist for his consciousness at all

Chaos often breeds life when order breeds habit

The main dangers in this life are the people who want to change everything or nothing

The chains of habit are too weak to be felt until they are too strong to be broken

When you are accustomed to anything you are estranged from it

Habit if not resisted soon becomes necessity

How use doth breed a habit in a man

Habits are at first cobwebs then cables

The fox changes his skin but not his habits

His hair stood upright like porcupine quills

Bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave

Gray hair is a sign of age not of wisdom

The very hairs of your head are all numbered

The hoary beard is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness

There was never a saint with red hair

His hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him

The voice is Jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of Esau

Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth

As well be hanged for a sheep as a lamb

So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai

We must all hang together else we shalFall hang separately

If a man has important work and enough leisure and income to enable him to do it properly he is in possession of as much happiness as is good for any of the children of Adam

The greatest happiness you can have is knowing that you do not necessarily require happiness

Existence is a strange bargain Life owes us little we owe it everything The only true happiness comes from squandering ourselves for a purpose

Even if we cant be happy we must always be cheerful

New Years Day is every mans birthday

Happiness is the perpetual possession of being well deceived

To be without some of the things you want is an indispensable part of happiness

For the rational psychologically healthy man the desire for pleasure is the desire to celebrate his control over reality For the neurotic the desire for pleasure is the desire to escape from reality

It has never been given to a man to attain at once his happiness and his salvation

If thou workest at that which is before thee following right reason seriously vigorously calmly without allowing anything else to distract thee but keeping thy divine part pure as if thou shouldst be bound to give it back immediately if thou holdest to this expecting nothing fearing nothing but satisfied with thy present activity according to Nature and with heroic truth in every word and sound which thou utterest thou wilt live happy And there is no man who is able to prevent this

Love and respect are the most important aspects of parenting and of all relationships

Perhaps the best function of parenthood is to teach the young creature to love with safety so that it may be able to venture unafraid when later emotion comes the thwarting of the instinct to love is the root of all sorrow and not sex only but divinity itself is insulted when it is repressed To disapprove to condemnthe human soul shrivels under barren righteousness

We wander through this life together in a semidarkness in which none of us can distinguish exactly the features of his neighbour Only from time to time through some experience that we have of our companion or through some remark that he passes he stands for a moment close to us as though illuminated by a flash of lightning Then we see him as he really is

Humour is the first of the gifts to perish in a foreign tongue

The difficulty with humourists is that they will mix what they believe with what they dont whichever seems likelier to win an effect

The teller of a mirthful tale has latitude allowed him We are content with less than absolute truth

He that jokes confesses

There are things of deadly earnest that can only be safely mentioned under cover of a joke

Humour is the only test of gravity and gravity of humour for a subject which will not bear raillery is suspicious and a jest which will not bear serious examination is false wit

Everything is funny as long as it is happening to somebody else

A satirist is a man who discovers unpleasant things about himself and then says them about other people

Humour is emotional chaos remembered in tranquillity

The best definition of humour I know is humour may be defined as the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof I think this is the best I know because I wrote it myself

A humorist is a man who feels bad but who feels good about it

Humour plays close to the big hot fire which is the truth and the reader feels the heat

Wit is the only wall Between us and the dark

Look at Jewish history Unrelieved lamenting would be intolerable So for every ten Jews beating their breasts God designated one to be crazy and amuse the breastbeaters By the time I was five I knew I was that one

Mirthfulness is in the mind and you cannot get it out It is just as good in its place as conscience or veneration

Novelist Peter de Vries like Adlai Stevenson and Mark Twain has suffered from the American assumption that anyone with a sense of humour is not to be taken seriously

Humour can be dissected as a frog can but the thing dies in the process

Humour is the contemplation of the finite from the point of view of the infinite

The total absence of humour from the Bible is one of the most singular things in all literature

Laughter is the closest thing to the grace of God

Humour is richly rewarding to the person who employs it It has some value in gaining and holding attention But it has no persuasive value at all

Humour is the most engaging cowardice With it myself I have been able to hold some of my enemy in play far out of gunshot

A comedian is a fellow who finds other comedians too humorous to mention

If its sanity youre after Theres no recipe like Laughter Laugh it off

Humour is an affirmation of dignity a declaration of mans superiority to all that befalls him

Comedy is simply a funny way of being serious

Comedy is tragedy plus time

Caricature putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth

The ability to laugh at life is right at the top with love and communication in the hierarchy of our needs Humour has much to do with pain it exaggerates the anxieties and absurdities we feel so that we gain distance and through laughter relief

He deserves paradise who makes his companions laugh

Laughter is the shortest distance between two people

You encourage a comic man too much and he gets silly

Any man will admit if need be that his sight is not good or that he cannot swim or shoots badly with a rifle but to touch upon his sense of humour is to give him mortal affront

Anything awful makes me laugh I misbehaved once at a funeral

Wit is far more often a shield than a lance

If theres anything I hate its the word humorist I feel like countering with the word seriousist

A jests prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it never in the tongue Of him that makes it

Nonsense is an assertion of mans spiritual freedom in spite of all the oppressions of circumstance

Humour is just another defence against the universe

The great humorist forgets himself in his delighted contemplation of other people

The role of a comedian is to make the audience laugh at a minimum of once every fifteen seconds

Laughter is the sensation of feeling good all over and showing it principally in one spot

He who laughs lasts

We are all here for a spell get all the good laughs you can

No one is more profoundly sad than he who laughs too much

A joke is an epigram on the death of a feeling

One loses so many laughs by not laughing at oneself

You can pretend to be serious but you cant pretend to be witty

Charles Dickens creation of Mr Pickwick did more for the elevation of the human race I say it in all seriousness than Cardinal Newmans Lead Kindly Light Amid the Encircling Gloom Newman only cried out for light in the gloom of a sad world Dickens gave it

The love of truth lies at the root of much humour

An empty stomach is not a good political adviser

If thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat

A hungry people listens not to reason nor cares for justice nor is bent by any prayers

Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look

All husbands are alike but they have different faces so you can tell them apart

A good husband should be deaf and a good wife blind

A good husband is never the first to go to sleep at night or the last to awake in the morning

Husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it

A man should be taller older heavier uglier and hoarser than his wife

Men are April when they woo December when they wed

As the husband is the wife is

Man is the only animal that can remain on friendly terms with the victims he intends to eat until he eats them

Hypocrisy is the homage which vice pays to virtue

He that hath the name to be an early riser may sleep till noon

We are not hypocrites in our sleep

No man is a hypocrite in his pleasures

The wolf was sick he vowed a monk to be But when he got well a wolf once more was he

Remember this If you work for a man in Heavens name work for him If he pays you wages which supply you bread and butter work for him speak well of him stand by the institution he represents If put to a pinch an ounce of loyalty is worth a pound of cleverness If you must vilify condemn and eternally disparage resign your position and when you are on the outside damn to your hearts content but as long as you are part of the institution do not condemn it

For neither man nor angel can discern hypocrisy the only evil that walks invisible

The teeth are smiling but is the heart

Affectation is a greater enemy to the face than smallpox

It is a trick among the dishonest to offer sacrifices that are not needed or not possible to avoid making those that are required

When you say that you agree to a thing in principle you mean that you have not the slightest intention of carrying it out

An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile hoping it will eat him last

There is luxury in selfreproach When we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has the right to blame us

Extremes meet and there is no better example than the naughtiness of humility

Hypocrite mouth one way belly nother way

When the fox preaches look to your geese

I hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time That would be hypocrisy

Reasons are whores

Saint abroad and a devil at home

Every man is a hypocrite

Hypocrites do the devils drudgery in Christs livery

Hypocrisy is the homage which vice renders to virtue

Who stole the livery of the court of Heaven To serve the Devil in

I hope you have not been leading a double life pretending to be wicked and being really good all the time That would be hypocrisy

For parlour use the vague generality is a lifesaver

If anyone has a new idea in this country there are twice as many people who keep putting a man with a red flag in front of it

If you are possessed by an idea you find it expressed everywhere you even smell it

In a war of ideas it is people who get killed

To say that an idea is fashionable is to say I think that it has been adulterated to a point where it is hardly an idea at all

You cannot put a rope around the neck of an idea you cannot put an idea up against a barracksquare wall and riddle it with bullets you cannot confine it in the strongest prison cell that your slaves could ever build

Great ideas are not charitable

For an idea ever to be fashionable is ominous since it must afterwards be always oldfashioned

Every man with an idea has at least two or three followers

An idea is a feat of association and the height of it is a good metaphor

Every time a man puts a new idea across he finds ten men who thought of it before he did but they only thought of it

There is no adequate defence except stupidity against the impact of a new idea

No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come

Mans mind stretched to a new idea never goes back to its original dimensions

Ideas wont keep something must be done about them

Ideas as distinguished from events are never unprecedented

Whats a cult It just means not enough people to make a minority

A cold in the head causes less suffering than an idea

Very simple ideas lie within the reach only of complex minds Remy de Gourmont An idea is salvation by imagination

Only the wise possess ideas the greater part of mankind are possessed by them

Big ideas are so hard to recognize so fragile so easy to kill Dont forget that all of you who dont have them

Great ideas originate in the muscles

The material universe exists only in the mind

Ideas must work through the brains and the arms of good and brave men or they are no better than dreams

No army can withstand the strength of an idea whose time has come

An idea to be suggestive must come to the individual with the force of a revelation

It is only liquid currents of thought that move men and the world

A perpetual holiday is a good working definition of Hell

A physician can sometimes bury the scythe of death but he has no power over the sand in the hourglass

Life is a zoo in a jungle

More free time means more time to waste The worker who used to have only a little time in which to get drunk and beat his wife now has time to get drunk beat his wife and watch TV

It is no rest to be idle

It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of work to do

There is less leisure now than in the Middle Ages when one third of the year consisted of holidays and festivals

Any fool can be fussy and rid himself of energy all over the place but a man has to have something in him before he can settle down to do nothing

Extreme busyness whether at school or college kirk or market is a symptom of deficient vitality and a faculty for idleness implies a catholic appetite and a strong sense of personal identity

The hardest work is to go idle

Of all our faults the one that we excuse most easily is idleness

Idleness like kisses to be sweet must be stolen

With enough ifs we could put Paris into a bottle

We are lazier in our minds than in our bodies

Nothing is so intolerable to man as being fully at rest without passion without business without entertainment without care It is then that he recognizes that he is empty insufficient dependent ineffectual From the depths of his soul now comes at once boredom gloom sorrow chagrin resentment and despair

He is idle that might be better employed

Ninetenths of the miseries and vices of mankind proceed from idleness

Even if a farmer intends to loaf he gets up in time to get an early start

Did nothing in particular and did it very well

If a soldier or labourer complains of the hardship of his lot set him to do nothing

How beautiful it is to do nothing and then rest afterward

Some people have a perfect genius for doing nothing and doing it assiduously

Idleness is the holiday of fools

He is not only idle who does nothing but he is idle who might be better employed

For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do

Against stupidity the very gods Themselves contend in vain

Her own mother lived the latter years of her life in the horrible suspicion that electricity was dripping invisibly all over the house

If I cannot brag of knowing something then I brag of not knowing it at any rate brag

Nothing sways the stupid more than arguments they cant understand

The empty vessel giveth a greater sound than the full barrel

There is more stupidity around than hydrogen and it has longer shelf life

To be ignorant of ones ignorance is the malady of the ignorant

The trouble aint that people are ignorant its that they know so much that aint so

There is nothing more frightening than ignorance in action

When an idea is wanting a word can always be found to take its place

If ignorance is indeed bliss it is a very low grade of the article

Not ignorance but ignorance of ignorance is the death of knowledge

Ignoramus a person unacquainted with certain kinds of knowledge familiar to yourself and having certain other kinds that you know nothing about

Ignorance is no excuse its the real thing

The good Lord set definite limits on mans wisdom but set no limits on his stupidity and thats just not fair

Everybody is ignorant only on different subjects

A weak mind does not accumulate force enough to hurt itself stupidity often saves a man from going mad

Little wit in the head makes much work for the feet

I am not ashamed to confess that I am ignorant of what I do not know

all ignorance toboggans into know and trudges up to ignorance again

The little I know I owe to my ignorance

It is a blind goose that cometh to the foxs sermon

And here poor fool with all my lore I stand no wiser than before

Truth can be outraged by silence quite as cruelly as by speech

You can do one of two things just shut up which is something I dont find easy or learn an awful lot very fast which is what I tried to do

Ignorance is no excuseits the real thing

My doctrine is this that if we see cruelty or wrong that we have the power to stop and do nothing we make ourselves sharers in the guilt

Whenever two good people argue over principles they are both right

Progress results only from the fact that there are some men and women who refuse to believe that what they know to be right cannot be done

The Wright brothers flew through the smoke screen of impossibility

Most of the basic truths of life sound absurd at first hearing

The good thing about being young is that you are not experienced enough to know you cannot possibly do the things you are doing

The young do not know enough to be prudent and therefore they attempt the impossibleand achieve it generation after generation

Sometimes it proves the highest understanding not to understand

Aerodynamically the bumblebee shouldnt be able to fly but the bumble bee doesnt know it so it goes on flying anyway

Lack of understanding is a great power Sometimes it enables men to conquer the world

An impossibility does not disturb us until its accomplishment shows what fools we were

Once you start asking questions innocence is gone

God may have been waiting for centuries for somebody ignorant enough of the impossible to do that thing

To some people the impossible is impossible

Some of my best friends are illusions Been sustaining me for years

Great things are accomplished by those who do not feel the impotence of man This is a precious gift

At first people refuse to believe that a strange new thing can be done then they begin to hope it can be done then they see it can be donethen it is done and all the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago

Ordinary people believe only in the possible Extraordinary people visualize not what is possible or probable but rather what is impossible And by visualizing the impossible they begin to see it as possible

Success is often achieved by those who dont know that failure is inevitable

It is our duty as men and women to proceed as though limits to our abilities do not exist

So long as we think dugout canoes are the only possibilityall that is real or can be realwe will never see the ship we will never feel the free wind blow

Men are always averse to enterprises in which they foresee difficulties

The greatest wisdom often consists in ignorance

Painting is easy when you dont know how but very difficult when you do

To measure up to all that is demanded of him a man must overestimate his capacities

Every true genius is bound to be naive

To write a good love letter you ought to begin without knowing what you mean to say and to finish without knowing what you have written

Today if you are not confused you are not thinking clearly

When we are not sure we are alive

Basic research is what Im doing when I dont know what Im doing

I have always wanted to be somebody but I see now I should have been more specific

I dont know what Im doing I dont know what actors do

In baseball you dont know nothing

I know it was wonderful but I dont know how I did it

What makes a good pinch hitter I wish the hell I knew

We couldnt possibly know where it would lead but we knew it had to be done

People think the Beatles know whats going on We dont Were just doing it

I dont know what humor is

Unprovided with original learning unformed in the habits of thinking unskilled in the arts of composition I resolved to write a book

When Columbus started out he didnt know where he was going when he got there he didnt know where he was and when he got back he didnt know where he had been

All I know about humor is that I dont know anything about it

It is a sign of strength not of weakness to admit that you dont know all the answers

I learn by going where I have to go

Whatever people in general do not understand they are always prepared to dislike the incomprehensible is always the obnoxious

One learns by doing the thing for though you think you know it you have no certainty until you try

No one knows what he can do until he tries

All decisions are made on insufficient evidence

Education is learning what you didnt even know you didnt know

Intelligence is really a kind of taste taste in ideas

Curiosity is the one thing invincible in Nature

The true test of character is how we behave when we dont know what to do

Nothing in this world can one imagine beforehand not the least thing Everything is made up of so many unique particulars that cannot be foreseen

The work will teach you how to do it

Life is my college May I graduate well and earn some honors

Living is a form of not being sure not knowing what next or how The moment you know how you begin to die a little The artist never entirely knows We guess We may be wrong but we take leap after leap in the dark

Where there is an unknowable there is a promise

I am not ashamed to confess that I am ignorant of wha I do not know

Ignorance never settles a question

Where ignorance is bliss Tis folly to be wise

Magic lives in curves not angles

Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion

As I was going up the stair I met a man who wasnt there He wasnt there again today I wish I wish hed stay away

The task of the real intellectual consists of analyzing illusions in order to discover their causes

An illusion which makes me happy is worth a verity which drags me to the ground

We must select the illusion which appeals to our temperament and embrace it with passion if we want to be happy

Winston Churchill is always expecting rabbits to come out of an empty hat

Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving

Every real object must cease to be what it seemed and none could ever be what the whole soul desired

Aspects are within us and who seems most kingly is king

Those who lose dreaming are lost

It is dangerous to let the public behind the scenes They are easily disillusioned and then they are angry with you for it was the illusion they loved

A rock pile ceases to be a rock pile the moment a single man contemplates it bearing within him the image of a cathedral

Ever let the Fancy roam Pleasure never is at home

Fools act on imagination without knowledge pedants act on knowledge without imagination

From ghoulies and ghosties and longleggedy beasties And things that go bump in the night good Lord deliver us

I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing but if we are to give everything its due twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too

Inspiration could be called inhaling the memory of an act never experienced

It was a year when Frankie thought about the world And she did not see it as a round school globe with the countries neat and differentcoloured She thought of the world as huge and cracked and loose and turning a thousand miles an hour

Saddle your dreams afore you ride em

The eyes are not responsible when the mind does the seeing

Were it not for imagination a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a duchess

Imagination grows by exercise and contrary to common belief is more powerful in the mature than in the young

The imagination of a boy is healthy and the mature imagination of a man is healthy but there is a space of life between in which the soul is in ferment the character undecided the way of life uncertain

His imagination resembled the wings of an ostrich It enabled him to run though not to soar

Imagination is the eye of the soul

Imagination is a poor substitute for experience

Imagination frames events unknown In wild fantastic shapes of hideous ruin And what it fears creates

Reason respects the differences and imagination the similitudes of things

The sky is the daily bread of the eyes

Let us leave pretty women to men without imagination

To make a prairie it takes clover and one bee one clover and a bee and revery The revery alone will do if bees are few

The value of a sentiment is the amount of sacrifice you are prepared to make for it

It is good to know the truth but it is better to speak of palm trees

Imagination is more important than knowledge

Imagination is the eye of the soul

He who has imagination without learning has wings but no feet

The human race is governed by its imagination

Imagination disposes of everything it creates beauty justice and happiness which is everything in this world

Most people go on living their everyday life frightened half indifferent they behold the ghostly tragicomedy that has been performed on the international stage before the eyes and ears of the world

We are in truth more than a half of what we are by imitation

When people are free to do as they please they usually imitate each other

Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble

There is a difference between imitating a good man and counterfeiting him

Every man is a borrower and a mimic life is theatrical and literature a quotation

We do not imitate but are a model to others

The crow that mimics a cormorant gets drowned

We love in others what we lack ourselves and would be everything but what we are

Immature poets imitate mature poets steal

Agesilaus the Spartan king was once invited to hear a mimic imitate the nightingale but declined with the comment that he had heard the nightingale itself

Fewer things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example

Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery

It is impossible to imitate Voltaire without being Voltaire

He who imitates what is evil always goes beyond the example that is set on the contrary he who imitates what is good always falls short

A good imitation is the most perfect originality

What is human is immortal

A good man never dies

I have been dying for twenty years now I am going to live

Immortality is the glorious discovery of Christianity

Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto God who gave it

Oh may I join the choir invisible Of those immortal dead who live again

Life is the childhood of our immortality

The nearer I approach the end the plainer I hear around me the immortal symphonies of the worlds which invite me It is marvelous yet simple

Our hope of immortality does not come from any religion but nearly all religions come from that hope

I wish to believe in immortality I wish to live with you forever

No one could ever meet death for his country without the hope of immortality

There is no death the stars go down to rise upon some fairer shore

For tho from out our bourne of time and place The flood may bear me far I hope to see my Pilot face to face When I have crost the bar

Never did Christ utter a single word attesting to a personal resurrection and a life beyond the grave

The mission of the United States is one of benevolent assimilation

Take up the white mans burden Send forth the best ye breed Go bind your sons to exile To serve your captives need

The conquest of the earth which mostly means the taking it away from those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than ourselves is not a pretty thing when you look into it

You cannot make a crab walk straight

You cant get blood out of a turnip

You cant make a silk purse out of a sows ear

Few things are impossible to diligence and skill

Never let me hear that foolish word again

Impossible is a word only to be found in the dictionary of fools

To the timid and hesitating everything is impossible because it seems so

It is necessary to try to surpass ones self always this occupation ought to last as long as life

People seldom improve when they have no other model but themselves to copy after

Slumber not in the tents of your fathers The world is advancing Advance with it

I never thrust my nose into other mens porridge It is no bread and butter of mine Every man for himself and God for us all

Can anything be so elegant as to have few wants and to serve them ones self

Voyager upon lifes sea To yourself be true And whateer your lot may be Paddle your own canoe

I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than to be crowded on a velvet cushion

Lack of something to feel important about is almost the greatest tragedy a man may have

There is nothing harder than the softness of indifference

Communists have committed great crimes but at least they have not stood aside like an established society and been indifferent I would rather have blood on my hands than water like Pilate

Hate is not the opposite of love apathy is

What makes life dreary is want of motive

The hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crisis maintain their neutrality

Once conform once do what others do because they do it and a kind of lethargy steals over all the finer senses of the soul

Not to he who is offensive to us are we most unfair but to he who does not concern us at all

Most of us have no real loves and no real hatreds Blessed is love less blessed is hatred but thrice accursed is that indifference which is neither one nor the other

The only menace is inertia

Tolerance is a tremendous virtue but the immediate neighbours of tolerance are apathy and weakness

The true opposite of love is not hate but indifference Hate bad as it is at least treats the neighbour as a thou whereas indifference turns the neighbour into an it a thing This is why we may say that there is actually one thing worse than evil itself and that is indifference to evil In human relations the nadir of morality the lowest point as far as Christian ethics is concerned is manifest in the phrase T couldnt care less

If moderation is a fault then indifference is a crime

Indifference may not wreck a mans life at any one turn but it will destroy him with a kind of dryrot in the long run

An institution is the lengthened shadow of one man

Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not

The worth of a state in the long run is the worth of the individuals composing it

Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might

The more we do the more we can do the more busy we are the more leisure we have

In this theater of mans life it is reserved only for God and angels to be lookers on

I am a part of all that I have met

The humblest individual exerts some influence either for good or evil upon others

A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump

A woman is more influenced by what she divines than by what she is told

If the nose of Cleopatra had been shorter the whole face of the earth would have been changed

Thou wert my guide philosopher and friend

We set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds us

Brutes leave ingratitude to man

This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors arm Quite vanquishd him then burst his mighty heart

Do you know what is more hard to bear than the reverses of fortune It is the baseness the hideous ingratitude of man

The injury we do and the one we suffer are not weighed in the same scales

Recompense injury with justice and recompense kindness with kindness

If the other person injures you you may forget the injury but if you injure him you will always remember

In an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance need not be feared

There is no ghost so difficult to lay as the ghost of an injury

There is but one blasphemy and that is injustice

He who commits injustice is ever made more wretched than he who suffers it

When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying I am innocent of the blood of this just person See to it Then answered all the people and said His blood be on us and on our children

The truly innocent are those who not only are guiltless themselves but who think others are

The innocent is the person who explains nothing

Whoever blushes is already guilty true innocence is ashamed of nothing

Through our own recovered innocence we discern the innocence of our neighbours

As innocent as a newlaid egg

Had laws not been we never had been blamd For not to know we sinnd is innocence

Good is when I steal other peoples wives and cattle bad is when they steal mine

It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer

As innocent as a newlaid egg

They that know no evil will suspect none

Innocence finds not near so much protection as guilt

No excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness

Mad as a March hare

I teach that all men are mad

Insanity in individuals is something rare but in groups parties nations and epochs it is the rue

That he is mad tis true tis true tis pity And pity tis tis true

Whom Jupiter would destroy he first drives mad

Though this be madness yet there is method in t

No man was ever great without a touch of divine afflatus

A writer is rarely so well inspired as when he talks about himself

Inspiration and genius one and the same

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

Never let go of that fiery sadness called desire

For every man there exists a bait which he cannot resist swallowing

The moment somebody says to me This is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me

Discontent is the first step in progress No one knows what is in him till he tries and many would never try if they were not forced to

All progress is based upon a universal innate desire on the part of every living organism to live beyond its income

It is the spur of ignorance the consciousness of not understanding and the curiosity about that which lies beyond that are essential to our progress

One starts an action simply because one must do something

What you are must always displease you if you would attain to that which you are not

If youre good to your staff when things are going well theyll rally when times go bad

Praise out of season or tactlessly bestowed can freeze the heart as much as blame

The pitcher cries for water to carry and a person for work that is real

Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force

Beware of trying to accomplish anything by force

Trust your own instinct Your mistakes might as well be your own instead of someone elses

I feel there are two people inside of meme and my intuition If I go against her shell screw me every time and if I follow her we get along quite nicely

I give myself sometimes admirable advice but I am incapable of taking it

Some of the finest moral intuitions come to quite humble people The visiting of lofty ideas doesnt depend on formal schooling Think of those Galilean peasants

Im the foe of moderation the champion of excess If I may lift a line from a diehard whose identity is lost in the shuffle Id rather be strongly wrong than weakly right

Conviction without experiences makes for harshness

Without fanaticism we cannot accomplish anything

To have character is to be big enough to take life on

The trouble is that not enough people have come together with the firm determination to live the things which they say they believe

All I can do is act according to my deepest instinct and be whatever I must becrazy or ribald or sad or compassionate or loving or indifferent That is all anybody can do

Instinct is untaught ability

Trusting our intuition often saves us from disaster

Trust your gut

It is our business to go as we are impelled

Intuition appears to be the extrasensory perception of reality

Common sense is instinct Enough of it is genius

A goose flies by a chart which the Royal Geographical Society could not improve

I go by instinct I dont worry about experience

Unconsciousness spontaneity instinct hold us to the earth and dictate the relatively good and useful

Every time you dont follow your inner guidance you feel a loss of energy loss of power a sense of spiritual deadness

Every time a resolve or fine glow of feeling evaporates without bearing fruit it is worse than a chance lost it works to hinder future emotions from taking the normal path of discharge

It is only by following your deepest instinct that you can lead a rich life

Instinct is the nose of the mind

One of the reasons why so few of us ever act instead of react is because we are continually stifling our deepest impulses

A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them for they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world

If you let your fear of consequence prevent you from following your deepest instinct your life will be safe expedient and thin

Everyone was searching for a formula for survival and the only formula that worked was no formula Instinct thats all you had to go on

I feel there are two people inside meme and my intuition If I go against her shell screw me every time and if I follow her we get along quite nicely

To be faithful to your instincts and the impulses that carry you in the direction of the excellence you most desire and value surely that is to lead the noble life

We each need to let our intuition guide us and then be willing to follow that guidance directly and fearlessly

By learning to contact listen to and act on our intuition we can directly connect to the higher power of the universe and allow it to become our guiding force

The struggle to learn to listen to and respect our own intuitive inner promptings is the greatest challenge of all

Once you get rid of the idea that you must please other people before you please yourself and you begin to follow your own instinctsonly then can you be successful You become more satisfied and when you are other people tend to be satisfied by what you do

If you do not express your own original ideas if you do not listen to your own being you will have betrayed yourself

Every human being has like Socrates an attendant spirit and wise are they who obey its signals If it does not always tell us what to do it always cautions us what not to do

Trust the instinct to the end though you can render no reason

The truth of a thing is the feel of it not the think of it

Spend time every day listening to what your muse is trying to tell you

When I do things without any explanation but just with spontaneity I can be sure that I am right

Analysis kills spontaneity The grain once ground into flour germinates no more

Spontaneity is the quality of being able to do something just because you feel like it at the moment of trusting your instincts of taking yourself by surprise and snatching from the clutches of your wellorganized routine a bit of unscheduled pleasure

I never believe facts Canning said nothing was so fallacious as facts except figures

Trust your hunches Hunches are usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level Warning Do not confuse your hunches with wishful thinking This is the road to disaster

Facts are not truths they are not conclusions they are not even premisses but in the nature and parts of premisses

Statistics are no substitute for judgement

You cannot know what you cannot feel

We should chiefly depend not upon that department of the soul which is most superficial and fallible our reason but upon that department that is deep and sure which is instinct

I make all my decisions on intuition I throw a spear into the darkness That is intuition Then I must send an army into the darkness to find the spear That is intellect

Instinct is intelligence incapable of selfconsciousness

Every advance in social progress removes us more and more from the guidance of instinct obliging us to depend upon reason for the assurance that our habits are really agreeable to the laws of health

Follow your instincts Thats where true wisdom manifests itself

Impulse without reason is not enough and reason without impulse is a poor makeshift

The shrewd guess the fertile hypothesis the courageous leap to a tentative conclusionthese are the most valuable coin of the thinker at work

A trembling in the bones may carry a more convincing testimony than the dry documented deductions of the brain

Calculation never made a hero

We are so clothed in rationalization and dissemblance that we can recognize but dimly the deep primal impulses that motivate us

All our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling

Reason ruling alone is a force confining and passion unattended is a flame that burns to its own destruction

Modern mans besetting temptation is to sacrifice his direct perceptions and spontaneous feelings to his reasoned reflections to prefer in all circumstances the verdict of his intellect to that of his immediate intuitions

Decisions particularly important ones have always made me sleepy perhaps because I know that I will have to make them by instinct and thinking things out is only what other people tell me I should do

Systems die instincts remain

I do not believe that the deeper problems of living can ever be answered by the process of thought I believe that life itself teaches us either patience with regard to them or reveals to us possible solutions when our hearts are pressed close against duties and sorrows and experiences of all kinds

Life is one long struggle between conclusions based on abstract ways of conceiving cases and opposite conclusions prompted by our instinctive perception of them

Nothing reaches the intellect before making its appearance in the senses

Instinct guides the animal better than the man In the animal it is pure in man it is led astray by his reason and intelligence

Ideas pull the trigger but instinct loads the gun

Wellbred instinct meets reason halfway

Good instincts usually tell you what to do long before your head has figured it out

Pure logic is the ruin of the spirit

When a man begins to reason he ceases to feel

A mind all logic is like a knife all blade It makes the hand bleed that uses it

The mind can assert anything and pretend it has proved it My beliefs I test on my body on my intuitional consciousness and when I get a response there then I accept

People who lean on logic and philosophy and rational exposition end by starving the best part of the mind

The brain is not and cannot be the sole or complete organ of thought and feeling

Imagination is more important than knowledge

Some other faculty than the intellect is necessary for the apprehension of reality

Command by instinct is swifter subtler deeper more accurate more in touch with reality than command by conscious mind The discovery takes ones breath away

No one is more liable to make mistakes than the man who acts only on reflection

Nothing is impossible when we follow our inner guidance even when its direction may threaten us by reversing our usual logic

A true history of human events would show that a far larger proportion of our acts are the results of sudden impulses and accident than of that reason of which we so much boast

It is wisdom to believe the heart

I follow my heart for I can trust it

The intellect is always fooled by the heart

There are no rules Just follow your heart

Man becomes man only by his intelligence but he is man only by his heart

It is the heart always that sees before the head can see

It is only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential is invisible to the eye

Great thoughts always come from the heart

It is the heart which experiences God not the reason

The heart has reasons which reason cannot understand

In making our decisions we must use the brains that God has given us But we must also use our hearts which He also gave us

Just be what you are and speak from your guts and heartits all a man has

When love is not madness it is not love

To live is like to love all reason is against it and all healthy instinct is for it

The thinker philosophizes as the lover loves Even were the consequences not only useless but harmful he must obey his impulse

What you intuitively desire that is possible to you

Falling in love is one of the activities forbidden that tiresome person the consistently reasonable man

If you really want something you can figure out how to make it happen

Our real duty is always found running in the direction of our worthiest desires

The essential conditions of everything you do must be choice love passion

Passion and prejudice govern the world only under the name of reason

The conclusions of passion are the only reliable ones

Man is a passion which brings a will into play which works an intelligence

Life is not governed by will or intention Life is a question of nerves and fibers and slowly builtup cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams

We do not wish ardently for what we desire only through reason

Trust your hunches Theyre usually based on facts filed away just below the conscious level

Inspiration does not come like a bolt nor is it kinetic energy striving but it comes to us slowly and quietly and all the time

Intuition is given only to him who has undergone long preparation to receive it

You must train your intuitionyou must trust the small voice inside you which tells you exactly what to say what to decide

You have first an instinct then an opinion then a knowledge as the plant has root bud and fruit Trust the instinct to the end though you can render no reason

A hunch is creativity trying to tell you something

I move on feeling and have learned to distrust those who dont

Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didnt

Instinct is a powerful form of natural energy perhaps comparable in humans to electricity or even atomic energy in the mechanical world

Cherish your emotions and never undervalue them

But are not this struggle and even the mistakes one may make better and do they not develop us more than if we kept systematically away from emotions

Many a man gets weary of clamping down on his rough impulses which if given occasional release would encourage the living of life with salt in it in place of dust

We shall keep our horizon perfectly absolutely crystallinely open ready every day for the scouring gales of impulse

Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain but simply points the way

Every time Ive done something that doesnt feel right its ended up not being right

None of us can estimate what we do when we do it from instinct

I write out of instinct

The way to procure insults is to submit to them A man meets with no more respect than he exacts

Thou hast added insult to injury

It is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it

twill turn your eyeballs black and blue

Injuries may be forgiven but not forgotten

It seldom pays to be rude It never pays to be only halfrude

Lloyd George could not see a belt without hitting below it

Macaulay is well for awhile but one wouldnt live under Niagara

Be thou as chaste as ice as pure as snow thou shalt not escape calumny

A fly Sir may sting a stately horse and make him wince but one is but an insect and the other a horse still

Calumny is only the noise of madmen

To persevere in ones duty and be silent is the best answer to calumny

Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you

Young men soon give and soon forget affronts Old age is slow in both

As long as there are readers to be delighted with calumny there will be found reviewers to calumniate

He that flings dirt at another dirtieth himself most

It takes your enemy and your friend working together to hurt you to the heart the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you

Calumny requires no proof The throwing out of malicious imputations against any character leaves a stain which no afterrefutation can wipe out To create an unfavourable impression it is not necessary that certain things should be true but that they have been said

It is often better not to see an insult than to avenge it

Abuse a man unjustly and you will make friends for him

One of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down

Alive ridiculous and dead forgot

Ill give you an idea of what kind of a guy he was St Francis would have punched him in the mouth

He loves to eat he puts mayonnaise on an aspirin

Apparently he was not the sharpest quill on the porcupine if you get my drift

You might say he was one taco short of a combination platter

I cant believe that out of a hundred thousand sperm you were the quickest

Cheap If he was at the Last Supper he would have asked for separate checks

Ive just learned about his illness lets hope its nothing trivial

Why does our host always have tears in his eyes after sex Due to the pepper spray

I take him to McDonalds just to watch him eat and see the numbers change

Mr Attlee is a very modest man But then he has much to be modest about

After a year of therapy my psychiatrist said to me Maybe life isnt for everyone

The only way she could get a standing ovation would be if she sang The StarSpangled Banner

His voice is to entertainment what the kazoo is to classical music

Some people can carry a tune but they seem to stagger under the load

Every word she writes is a lie including and and the

When she told her doctor that she always wanted to keep her weight exactly the same as her IQ he gave her a lecture on anorexia

I hope you live to be as old as your jokes

If he can remember so many jokes With all the details that mold them Why cant he recall with equal skill All the times he told them

I just thought you might like to know that I passed a kennel on the way to the game and your mother is all right

Heres a good rule of thumb Too clever is dumb

We should take care not to make the intellect our god it has of course powerful muscles but no personality

The intellect is always fooled by the heart

The job of intellectuals is to come up with ideas and all weve been producing is footnotes

Lord Birkenhead is very clever but sometimes his brains go to his head All zeal runs down What replaces it Intellectualism

Will and intellect are one and the same thing

The highest intellects like the tops of mountains are the first to catch and to reflect the dawn

An intellectual is someone whose mind watches itself

I hate intellectuals They are from the top down I am from the bottom up

Think sideways

A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking

The brain is the citadel of sense perception

My body has certainly wandered a good deal but I have an uneasy suspicion that my mind has not wandered enough

There are innumerable instances suggesting that modern intellectuals do not believe themselves that they dont really believe what they say that they say certain things only in order to assure themselves that they possess opinions and ideas that are different from those that are entertained by the common herd of men

Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain but simply points the way

The intellect of man is forced to choose Perfection of the life or of the work

An intellectual is a man who takes more words than necessary to tell more than he knows

The common sense is that which judges the things given to it by other senses

Intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct from ability which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended

Intuition becomes increasingly valuable in the new information society precisely because there is so much data

The unluckiest insolvent in the world is the man whose expenditure is too great for his income of ideas

To the good listener half a word is enough

Time has a way of demonstrating the most stubborn are the most intelligent

Intelligence must follow faith never precede it and never destroy it

Intelligence is derived from two words inter and legere inter meaning between and legere meaning to choose An intelligent person therefore is one who has learned to choose between He knows that good is better than evil that confidence should supersede fear that love is superior to hate that gentleness is better than cruelty forbearance than intolerance compassion than arrogance and that truth has more virtue than ignorance

One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence

The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like the condemned man who is proud of his large cell

The sign of an intelligent people is their ability to control emotions by the application of reason

Never tell people how to do things Tell them what to do and they will surprise you with their ingenuity

I not only use all the brains I have but all I can borrow

Intelligence is not all that important in the exercise of power and is often in point of fact useless Just as a leader doesnt need intelligence a man in my job doesnt need too much of it either

The cuckoo who is on to himself is halfway out of the clock

Ive had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am

All the crimes on earth do not destroy so many of the human race nor alienate so much property as drunkenness

Bacchus has drowned more men than Neptune

Of all calamities this is the greatest

The smaller the drink the clearer the head

Drunkenness is nothing but voluntary madness

O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts

The devil loves nothing better than the intolerance of reformers

It were better to be of no church than to be bitter for any

To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance

He that falls in love with himself will have no rivals

Love yourself first and everything else falls into line

Never pretend to a love which you do not actually feel for love is not ours to command

Perhaps the feelings that we experience when we are in love represent a normal state Being in love shows a person who he should be

The love of liberty is the love of others the love of power is the love of ourselves

Love is like playing the piano First you must learn to play by the rules then you must forget the rules and play from your heart

Love grows by giving The love we give away is the only love we keep The only way to retain love is to give it away

Without love benevolence becomes egotism

You cannot be lonely if you like the person youre alone with

Relish love in your old age Aged love is like aged wine it becomes more satisfying more refreshing more valuable more appreciated and more intoxicating

Guard within yourself that treasure kindness Know how to give without hesitation how to lose without regret how to acquire without meanness know how to replace in your heart by the happiness of those you love the happiness that may be wanting to yourself

If it is a virtue to love my neighbor as a human being it must be a virtue and not a vice to love myself since I am a human being too

Since love grows within you so beauty grows For love is the beauty of the soul

Selflove my liege is not so vile a sin as selfneglecting

Out of love you can speak with straight fury

Whateer th Almightys subsequent command His first command is this Man love thyself

Selflove seems so often unrequited

Love is above all else the gift of oneself

A heart that loves is always young

Who so loves believes the impossible

Accept the things To which fate binds you and Love the people with whom fate Brings you together But do so with all your heart

Have you ever been at sea in a dense fog when it seemed as if a tangible white darkness shut you in and the great ship tense and anxious groped her way toward the shore with plummet and soundingline and you waited with beating heart for something to happen I was like that ship before my education began only I was without compass or sounding line and no way of knowing how near the harbor was Light Give me light was the wordless cry of my soul and rhe light of love shone on me in that very hour

Love can be understood only from the inside as a language can be understood only by someone who speaks it as a world can be understood only by someone who lives in it

Want the mistress of invention

A tool is but the extension of a mans hand and a machine is but a complex tool And he that invents a machine augments the power of a man and the wellbeing of mankind

God hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions

When Erin first rose from the darkswelling flood God blessed the green island he saw it was good The Emerald of Europe it sparkled and shone In the ring of this world the most precious stone

Whether on the scaffold high Or on the battlefield we die Oh what matter when for Erin dear we fall

You may have the universe if I may have Italy

Open my heart and you will see Graved inside of it Italy

Beyond the Alps lies Italy

On desperate seas long wont to roam Thy hyacinth hair they classic face Thy naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome

My soul today Is far away Sailing the Vesuvian Bay

He that is not jealous is not in love

In jealousy there is more selflove than love

Jealousy is an awkward homage which inferiority renders to merit

O jealousy thou magnifier of trifles

Jealousys eyes are green

A man who could make so vile a pun would not scruple to pick a pocket

Many a true word is spoken in jest

Alas poor Yorick I knew him Horatio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy

Jesters do often prove prophets

The Jews were Gods chosen people

I will make of thee a great nation and I will bless thee and make thy name great

To undo a Jew is charity and not sin

It is not possible for Christians to take part in antiSemitism We are Semites spiritually

I am a Jew Hath not a Jew eyes hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with die same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is

Neither cast ye your pearls before swine

Pearl of great price

Journalism has already come to be the first power in the land

Get your facts first and then you can distort em as much as you please

Burke said there were Three Estates in Parliament but in the Reporters gallery yonder there sat a Fourth Estate more important far than they all

Writing good editorials is chiefly telling the people what they think not what you think

The best use of a journal is to print the largest practical amount of important truth truth which tends to make mankind wiser and thus happier

Every newspaper editor owes tribute to the devil

I fear three newspapers more than a hundred thousand bayonets

We live under a government of men and morning newspapers

The newspapers Sir they are the most villainous licentious abominable infernal not that I ever read them no I make it a rule never to look into a newspaper

I wish you all the joy that you can wish

The joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days

All human joys are swift of wing For heaven doth so allot it That when you get an easy thing You find you havent got it

A thing of beauty is a joy forever

Sweets with sweets war not joy delights in joy

I have drunken deep of joy And I will taste no other wine tonight

It is better that a judge should lean on the side of compassion than severity

A Daniel come to judgment yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honor thee

Let the judges answer to the question of law and the jurors to the matter of fact

The cold neutrality of an impartial judge

Judges are but men and are swayed like other men by vehement prejudices This is corruption in reality give it whatever other name you please

Judges are apt to be naive simpleminded men

Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves

Four things belong to a judge to hear courteously to answer wisely to consider soberly and to decide impartially

Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting

One mans word is no mans word we should quietly hear both sides

Forbear to judge for we are sinners all

I know of no way of judging the future but by the past

We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done

Give your decision never your reasons your decisions may be right your reasons are sure to be wrong

Judge not that ye be not judged

Give every man thine ear but few thy voice Take each mans censure but reserve thy judgment

O judgment thou are fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason

One cool judgment is worth a thousand hasty councils The thing to do is to supply light and not heat

Are you good men and true

The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty and a premium upon ignorance stupidity and perjury

The jury passing on the prisoners life May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try

It is always wise as it is also fair to test a man by the standards of his own day and not by those of another

The strictest justice is sometimes the greatest injustice

Injustice is relatively easy to bear what stings is justice

Men are not hanged for stealing horses but that horses may not be stolen

A fox should not be on the jury at a gooses trial

Thwackum was for doing justice and leaving mercy to heaven

The Courts authority possessed of neither the purse nor the sword ultimately rests on substantial public confidence in its moral sanctions

Charity is no substitute for justice withheld

I would remind you that extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue

Neer of the living can the living judge too blind the affection or too fresh the grudge

I always felt from the beginning that you had to defend people you disliked and feared as well as those you admired

This is a court of law young man not a court of justice

The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when nations are strong they are not always just and when they wish to be just they are no longer strong

Nobody is poor unless he stand in need of justice

The hungry judges soon the sentence sign and wretches hang that jurymen may dine

There is no such thing as justice in or out of court

Justice is too good for some people and not good enough for the rest

Injustice never rules forever

Acquittal of the guilty damns the judge

There is no virtue so truly great and godlike as justice

The path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day

There is no such thing as justice in or out of court

Delay of justice is injustice

The spirits of just men made perfect

Gods mill grinds slow but sure

The sword of the law should never fall but on those whose guilt is so apparent as to be pronounced by their friends as well as foes

Render therefore to all their dues

He who decides a case without hearing the other side though he decide justly cannot be considered just

This bond is forfeit And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh

Thrice is he armd that hath his quarrel just And he but naked though lockd up in steel Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted

Let justice be done though the heavens fall

Have you had a kindness shown Pass it on Twas not given for thee alone Pass it on Let it travel down the years Let it wipe anothers tears Til in Heaven the deed appears Pass it on

Their cause I plead plead it in heart and mind A fellowfeeling makes one wondrous kind

At little more than kin and less than kind

Yet do I fear thy nature It is too full o the milk of human kindness

Kindness gives birth to kindness

Some women blush when they are kissed some call for the police some swear some bite But the worst are those who laugh

Gin a body meets a body Comin through the rye Gin a body kiss a body Need a body cry

Come lay thy head upon my breast And I will kiss thee into rest

It was thy kiss Love that made me immortal

Give me a kisse and to that kisse a score Then to that twenty adde a hundred more A thousand to that hundred so kisse on To make that thousand up a million Treble that million and when that is done Lets kisse afresh as when we first begun

A long long kiss a kiss of youth and love

Stolen kisses are always sweetest

Jenny kissed me when we met Jumping from the chair she sat in Time you thief who love to get Sweets into your list put that in Say Im weary say Im sad Say that health and wealth have missed me Say Im growing old but add Jenny kissed me

See the mountains kiss high heaven And the waves clasp one another No sister flower would be forgiven If it disdained its brother And the sunlight clasps the earth And the moonbeams kiss the sea What are all these kissings worth If thou kiss not me

Lord I wonder what fool it was that first invented kissing

Drink to me only with thine eyes And I will pledge with mine Or leave a kiss but in the cup And Ill not look for wine

Soul meets soul on lovers lips

All men by nature desire to know

I am not young enough to know everything

I have tried to know absolutely nothing about a great many things and I have succeeded fairly well

Little minds are interested in the extraordinary great minds in the commonplace

Our knowledge can only be finite while our ignorance must necessarily be infinite

Pocket all your knowledge with your watch and never pull it out in company unless desired

President Reagan didnt always know what he knew

Ten lands are sooner known than one man

The public do not know enough to be experts yet know enough to decide between them

There are times I think I am not sure of something which I absolutely know

There are two kinds of statistics the kind you look up and the kind you make up

There was never an age in which useless knowledge was more important than in our own

Were drowning in information and starving for knowledge

You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough

Zeal without knowledge is fire without light

Our knowledge is a receding mirage in an expanding desert of ignorance

Knowledge is of two kinds we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it

As we acquire more knowledge things do not become more comprehensible but more mysterious

A man must carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge

Grace is given of God but knowledge is bought in the market

If a little knowledge is dangerous where is the man who has so much as to be out of danger

We owe almost all our knowledge not to those who have agreed but to those who have differed

Sit down before fact as a little child be prepared to give up every preconceived notion follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss nature leads or you shall learn nothing

The learned is happy nature to explore the fool is happy that he knows no more

One of the greatest joys known to man is to take a flight into ignorance in search of knowledge

I do not pretend to know what many ignorant men are sure of

A man only understands what is akin to something already existing in himself

Everybody gets so much common information all day long that they lose their common sense

Anyone who stops learning is old whether at twenty or eighty Anyone who keeps learning stays young The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind young

The first problem for all of us men and women is not to learn but to unlearn

We should live and learn but by the time weve learned its too late to live

The specialist is a man who fears the other subjects

All that men really understand is confined to a very small compass to their daily affairs and experience to what they have an opportunity to know and motives to study or practise The rest is affectation and imposture

There is much pleasure to be gained from useless knowledge

Every great advance in natural knowledge has involved the absolute rejection of authority

It isnt what we dont know that gives us trouble its what we know that aint so

In all affairs love religion politics or business its a healthy idea now and then to hang a question mark on things you have long taken for granted

Knowledge is power

Man is not weak knowledge is more than equivalent to force The master of mechanics laughs at strength

To know that we know what we know and that we do not know what we do not know that is true knowledge

The simplest questions are the hardest to answer

They know enough who know how to learn

Strange how much youve got to know Before you know how little you know

I take all knowledge to be my province

To be conscious that you are ignorant is a great step to knowledge

For knowledge too is itself a power

The only good is knowledge and the only evil ignorance

He that increaseth knowledge increascth sorrow

Our knowledge is the amassed thought and experience of innumerable minds

One cannot know everything

Knowledge is of two kinds We know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it

He who knows others is learned He who knows himself is wise

It aint the things you dont know what gets you into trouble its the things you know for sure what aint so

Better know nothing than halfknow many things

He that hath knowledge spareth his words

Then I began to think that it is very true which is commonly said that the onehalf of the world knoweth not how the other half liveth

We know what we are but know not what we may be

And seeing ignorance is the curse of God Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven

Know thyself

As for me all I know is that I know nothing

They can expect nothing but their labor for their pains

For as labor cannot produce without the use of land the denial of the equal right to use of land is necessarily the denial of the right of labor to its own produce

A truly American sentiment recognises the dignity of labor and the fact that honor lies in honest toil

Shall you complain who feed the world Who clothe the world Who house the world Shall you complain who are the world Of what the world may do As from this hour You use your power The world must follow you

Labor conquers all things

God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb

Mary had a little lamb Its fleece was white as snow And everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go

Like lambs to the slaughter

If a man own land the land owns him

The small landholders are the most precious part of a state

The land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me

That which is built upon the land goes with the land

Babel because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth

But for my own part it was Greek to me

I am the King of Rome and above grammar

Language as well as the faculty of speech was the immediate gift of God

The whole earth was of one language and of one speech

No man fully capable of his own language ever masters another

Language is not an abstract construction of the learned or of dictionarymakers but is something arising out of the work needs ties joys affections tastes of long generations of humanity and has its bases broad and low close to the ground

Rise with the lark and with the lark to bed

Hail to thee blithe Spirit Bird thou never wert That from Heaven or near it Pourest thy full heart In profuse strains of unpremeditated art

He laughs best who laughs last

To provoke laughter without joining in it greatly heightens the effect

I hasten to laugh at everything for fear of being obliged to weep

The man who cannot laugh is not only fit for treasons strategems and spoils but his whole life is already a treason and a stratagem

As the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of a fool

Man is the only creature endowed with the power of laughter

Man alone suffers so excruciatingly in the world that he was compelled to invent laughter

Laugh and the world laughs with you Weep and you weep alone For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth But has trouble enough of its own

Nothing is more silly than silly laughter

Appeal in law to put the dice into the box for another throw

Divorce is a game played by lawyers

Far more has been accomplished for the welfare and progress of mankind by preventing bad actions than by doing good ones

In England justice is open to all like the Ritz Hotel

It is as if the ordinary language we use every day has a hidden set of signals a kind of secret code

It usually takes 100 years to make a law and then after its done its work it usually takes 100 years to be rid of it

Law is the witness and external deposit of our moral life Its history is the history of the moral development of the race

Laws are the spiders webs which if anything small falls into them they ensnare it but large things break through and escape

Lawyers are the only persons in whom ignorance of the law is not punished

Lawyers spend a great deal of time shovelling smoke

Revenge is a kind of wild justice which the more mans nature runs to the more ought law to weed it out

That is the beauty of the Common Law it is a maze and not a motorway

The law of England is a very strange one it cannot compel anyone to tell the truth But what the law can do is to give you seven years for not telling the truth

Trudeau Yes well there are a lot of bleeding hearts around who just dont like to see people with helmets and guns All I can say is go on and bleed but it is more important to keep law and order in a society than to be worried about weakkneed people who we dont like the looks of Reporter At any cost How far would you go with that How far would you extend that Trudeau Well just watch me

When the 30yearold lawyer died he said to St Peter How can you do this to me a heart attack at my age Im only 30 Replied St Peter When we looked at your total hours billed we figured you were 95

You are remembered for the rules you break

Law begins when someone takes to doing something someone else does not like

Any fool can make a rule and every fool will mind it

Show me the man and Ill show you the law

A man may as well open an oyster without a knife as a lawyers mouth without a fee

No matter whether the Constitution follows the flag or not the Supreme Court follows the election returns

When you have no basis for an argument abuse the plaintiff

The adversary system is a kind of warfare in mufti

A jury consists of twelve persons chosen to decide who has the better lawyer

Lawyers are men who hire out their words and anger

Litigant a person about to give up his skin for the hope of retaining his bone

In America an acquittal doesnt mean youre innocent it means you beat the rap My clients lose even when they win

Law and order is one of the steps taken to maintain injustice

Whatever is enforced by command is more imputed to him who exacts than to him who performs

The life of the law has not been logic it has been experience

Every new time will give its law

Lawyers and painters can soon change white to black

No man is above the law and no man is below it nor do we ask any mans permission when we ask him to obey it

Fragile as reason is and limited as law is as the institutionalized medium of reason thats all we have standing between us and the tyranny of mere will and the cruelty of unbridled undisciplined feeling

A lawyers dream of heaven every man reclaimed his property at the resurrection and each tried to recover it from all his forefathers

A vague uneasiness the police Its like when you suddenly understand you have to undress in front of the doctor

A successful lawsuit is the one worn by a policeman

Those who are too lazy and comfortable to think for themselves and be their own judges obey the laws Others sense their own laws within them

Every skilled person is to be believed with reference to his own art

An excess of law inescapably weakens the rule of law

A judge is a law student who marks his own examination papers

I understand you undertake to overthrow my undertaking

The law locks up both man and woman Who steals the goose from off the common But lets the great felon loose Who steals the common from the goose

I know of no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution

Law school taught me one thing how to take two situations that are exactly the same and show how they are different

To some lawyers all facts are created equal

And whether youre an honest man or whether youre a thief depends on whose solicitor has given me my brief

The law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges to beg in the streets and to steal bread

In crossexamination as in fishing nothing is more ungainly than a fisherman pulled into the water by his catch

Well I dont know as I want a lawyer to tell me what I cannot do I hire him to tell me how to do what I want to do

The law must be stable and yet it must not stand still

An appeal is when ye ask wan court to show its contempt for another court

Law is nothing unless close behind it stands a warm living public opinion

If there were no bad people there would be no good lawyers

The aim of law is the maximum gratification of the nervous system of man

Laws like the spiders web catch the fly and let the hawk go free

Law is a bottomless pit

Possession is eleven points in the law

After an existence of nearly twenty years of almost innocuous desuetude these laws are brought forth

Reason is the life of the law nay the common law itself is nothing else but reason The law which is perfection of reason

If the law supposes that said Mr Bumble the law is a ass a idiot

Be you never so high the law is above you

Laws too gentle are seldom obeyed too severe seldom executed

The English laws punish vice the Chinese laws do more they reward virtue

Laws grind the poor and rich men rule the law

I know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution

If the law is upheld only by government officials then all law is at an end

The execution of the laws is more important than the making of them

The laws sometimes sleep but never die

All things obey fixed laws

Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Cae

There is no man so good who were he to submit all his thoughts and actions to the laws would not deserve hanging ten times in his life

Where law ends there tyranny begins

The law hath not been dead though it hath slept

A lawyer must first get on then get honor and then get honest

Our wrangling lawyers are so litigious and busy here on earth that I think they will plead their clients causes hereafter some of them in hell

It is a secret worth knowing that lawyers rarely go to law

A lawyers opinion is worth nothing unless paid for

The first thing we do lets kill all the lawyers

Most good lawyers live well work hard and die poor

He has a head that is for rent unfurnished

The lust for comfort that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest and then becomes a host and then a master

The lazy man gets round the sun as quickly as the busy one

It is the just doom of laziness and a gluttony to be inactive without ease and drowsy without tranquillity

Tomorrow is often the busiest day of the year

The lazy are always wanting to do something

Some folks can look so busy doing nothin that they seem indispensable

Indolence is a delightful but distressing state We must be doing something to be happy

Failure is not our only punishment for laziness there is also the success of others

He who would rule must hear and be deaf see and be blind

I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman but I have the heart and stomach of a King and of a King of England too

It is a characteristic of all movements and crusades that the psychopathic element rises to the top

It is much safer to obey than to rule

It is said that Mr Gladstone could persuade most people of most things and himself of anything

It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves

Nothing is more difficult and therefore more precious than to be able to decide

There are two levers for moving men interest and fear

To get others to come into our ways of thinking we must go over to theirs and it is necessary to follow in order to lead

With a good conscience our only sure reward with history the final judge of our deeds let us go forth to lead the land we love asking His blessing and His help but knowing that here on earth Gods work must truly be our own

Achilles absent was Achilles still

To lead the people walk behind them

I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles but today it means getting along with people

When you come into the presence of a leader of men you know that you have come into the presence of fire that it is best not uncautiously to touch that man that there is something that makes it dangerous to cross him

Ive got to follow them I am their leader

The reward of a general is not a bigger tent but command

A leader may symbolize and express what is best in his people like Pericles or what is worst like Hitler but he cannot successfully express what is only in his heart and not in theirs

A true leader always keeps an element of surprise up his sleeve which others cannot grasp but which keeps his public excited and breathless

If I advance follow me If I retreat kill me If I die avenge me

If I advance follow me If I retreat cut me down If I die avenge me

Follow me if I advance kill me if I retreat revenge me if I die

A frightened captain makes a frightened crew

As for the best leaders the people do not notice their existence The next best the people honour and praise The next the people fear and the next the people hate When the best leaders work is done the people say we did it ourselves

The slave begins by demanding justice and ends by wanting to wear a crown He must dominate in his turn

A leader is a dealer in hope

To lead means to direct and to exact and no man dares do either he might be unpopular What authority we are given now is a trinity the grin the generality and God the Word

Dictators are rulers who always look good until the last ten minutes

A chief is a man who assumes responsibility He says I was beaten he does not say My men were beaten

Every man of action has a strong dose of egotism pride hardness and cunning But all those things will be forgiven him indeed they will be regarded as high qualities if he can make them the means to achieve great ends

Dictators ride to and fro upon tigers from which they dare not dismount

I have no family My only responsibility is the welfare of Quebec I belong to the province

It is better to have a lion at the head of an army of sheep than a sheep at the head of an army of lions

Where there are no tigers a wildcat is very selfimportant

Ah John A John A how I love you How I wish I could trust you

I really believe my greatest service is in the many unwise steps I prevent

I have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat

I have never accepted what many people have kindly said namely that I have inspired the nation It was the nation and the race dwelling all around the globe that had the lion heart I had the luck to be called upon to give the roar

Winston has written four volumes about himself and called it World Crisis

Winston Churchill fifty per cent genius fifty per cent bloody fool

If you shoot at a king you must kill him

The final test of a leader is that he leaves behind in other men the conviction and the will to carry on

In Pierre Elliott Trudeau Canada has at last produced a political leader worthy of assassination

Every womans man and every mans woman

When we think we lead we most are led

An army of stags led by a lion would be better than an army of lions led by a stag

If the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch

Reason and judgment are the qualities of a leader

Much learning doth make thee mad

It is always in season for old men to learn

All wish to be learned but no one is willing to pay the price

Reading maketh a full man conference a ready man and writing an exact man

Wear your learning like your watch in a private pocket and do not pull it out and strike it merely to show that you have one

And still they gazed and still the wonder grew That one small head should carry all it knew

They have learned nothing and forgotten nothing

A little learning is a dangerous thing Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring Their shallow draughts intoxicate the brain And drinking largely sobers us again

A learned man is an idler who kills time by study

Men learn while they teach

Increased means and increased leisure are the two civilizers of man

The wisdom of a learned man cometh by opportunity of leisure

Leisure is the mother of philosophy

If you lend you either lose the money or gain an enemy

Better give a shilling than lend and lose half a crown

A good man showeth favor and lendeth

In a mans letters his soul lies naked

I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter

I have received no more than one or two letters in my life that were worth the postage

Travellers from afar can lie with impunity

Truth is the safest lie

All men are born truthful and die liars

The lie is a condition of life

It takes a wise man to handle a lie A fool had better remain honest

We pay a person the compliment of acknowledging his superiority whenever we lie to him

Who lies for you will lie against you

The cruellest lies are often told in silence

I deny the lawfulness of telling a lie to a sick man for fear of alarming him you have no business with consequences you are to tell the truth

I do not mind lying but I hate inaccuracy

A little inaccuracy sometimes saves tons of explanations

A halftruth is a whole lie

A liar should have a good memory

Oh dont tell me of facts I never believe in facts you know Canning said nothing was so fallacious as facts except figures

One who has both feet firmly planted in the air

Liberalism is trust of the people tempered by prudence conservatism distrust of the people tempered by fear

A liberal is a man who is willing to spend somebody elses money

Liberality consists less in giving much than in giving at the right moment

The liberal soul shall be made fat

Whats mine is yours and what is yours is mine

I am not so much concerned with the right of everyone to say anything he pleases as I am about our need as selfgoverning people to hear everything relevant

Liberty is always unfinished business

Rights that do not flow from duty well performed are not worth having

So free we seem so fettered fast we are

The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited he must not make himself a nuisance to other people

We look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms The first is freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way everywhere in the world The third is freedom from wanteverywhere in the world The fourth is freedom from fear anywhere in the world

Yes n how many years can some people exist before theyre allowed to be free Yes n how many times can a man turn his head pretending he just doesnt see The answer my friend is blowin in the wind

These are the times that try mens souls The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph

It is a fair summary of history to say that the safeguards of liberty have frequently been forged in cases involving not very nice people

The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right

Liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have

Let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the world Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty All this will not be finished in the first 100 days Nor will it be finished in the first 1000 days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet But let us begin Now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle year in and year out rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation a struggle against the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country My fellow citizens of the world ask not what America will do for you but what together we can do for the freedom of man

None can love freedom heartily but good men the rest love not freedom but licence

One should never put on ones best trousers to go out to battle for freedom and truth

I understand by freedom of spirit something quite definite the unconditional will to say No where it is dangerous to say No

Man was born free and everywhere he is in shackles

Liberty means responsibility That is why most men dread it

My definition of a free society is a society where it is safe to be unpopular

For two decades the state has been taking liberties and these liberties were once ours

By physical liberty I mean the right to do anything which does not interfere with the happiness of another By intellectual liberty I mean the right to think wrong

There can be no real freedom without the freedom to fail

Liberty as it is conceived by current opinion has nothing inherent about it it is a sort of gift or trust bestowed on the individual by the state pending good behaviour

The right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously

If liberty has any meaning it means freedom to improve

Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must like men undergo the fatigue of supporting it

Let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support any friend oppose any foe in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty

The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent

Send these the homeless tempest tossd to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door

To be truly free it takes more determination courage introspection and restraint than to be in shackles

Equality of opportunity is an equal opportunity to prove unequal talents

The greatest right in the world is the right to be wrong

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others giving away their last piece of bread They may have been few in number but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing the last of human freedoms to choose ones attitude in any given set of circumstances to choose ones own way

The world must be made safe for democracy Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty We have no selfish ends to serve We desire no conquest no domination We seek no indemnities for ourselves no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely give We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of nations can make them

A free man is as jealous of his responsibilities as he is of his liberties

All free men wherever they may live are citizens of Berlin And therefore as a free man I take pride in the words Ich bin ein Berliner

Liberty is the right to do what the law permits

Once freedom lights its beacon in a mans heart the gods are powerless against him

Equality is the result of human organization We are not born equal

When you have robbed a man of everything he is no longer in your power He is free again

The effect of liberty on individuals is that they may do what they please we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations

We are in bondage to the law in order that we may be free

People hardly ever make use of the freedom they have for example freedom of thought instead they demand freedom of speech as a compensation

Freedom is what you do with whats been done to you

The tree of liberty grows only when watered by the blood of tyrants

The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion

Libertys in every blow Let us do or die

Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty

Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

Give me liberty or give me death

The God who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time

Give me your tired your poor Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free The wretched refuse of your teeming shore Send these the homeless tempest tossed to me I lift my lamp beside the golden door

Give me the liberty to know to think to believe and to utter freely according to conscience above all other liberties

0 liberty how many crimes are committed in thy name

Liberty is the only thing you cannot have unless you are willing to give it to others

Liberty and Union now and for ever one and inseparable

1 have always in my own thought summed up individual liberty and business liberty and every other kind of liberty in the phrase that is common in the sporting world A free field and no favor

If anything happens to me tell every woman Ive ever gone with I was talking about her at the end That way theyll have to reevaluate me

They say such nice things about people at their funerals that it makes me sad to realize Im going to miss mine by just a few days

I am prepared to meet my Maker Whether my Maker is prepared for the ordeal of meeting me is another matter

I dont want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying

For my family to go on living the way they are living now I cant just die Ive got to die accidentally

I dont want to tell you how much insurance I carry with Prudential All I can say is When I go they go

Let us so live that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry

The trouble with life in the fast lane is that you get to the other end in an awful hurry

Memorial services are the cocktail parties of the geriatric set

I wont mind dying if I can tell St Peter a joke he hasnt heard

The other night while lying on a couch I reviewed the high point of my life and fell asleep

My mother always said that every time you do a good deed here on Earth youre storing up a treasure in heaven Which means Mother Teresas probably got some beachfront property up there and Im up to a box of Milk Duds and a Pez dispenser

Why this fuss about death Use your imagination try to visualize a world without death

Ninety percent of living is just showing up

And remember my sentimental friend that a heart is not judged by how much you love but by how much you are loved by others

Loves like the measles all the worse when it comes late in life

Ofttimes the test of courage becomes rather to live than to die

It is the happiness that comes from within that is lasting and fulfilling

We are never so happy nor so unhappy as we imagine

You have to believe in happiness or happiness never comes

Happiness is the meaning and the purpose of life the whole aim and end of human existence

The time to be happy is now The place to be happy is here

Our happiness depends on the habit of mind we cultivate So practice happy thinking every day Cultivate the merry heart develop the happiness habit and life will become a continual feast

Humor is the healthy way of feeling distance between ones self and the problem a way of standing off and looking at ones problems with perspective

Humor enables one to live in the midst of tragic events without becoming a tragic figure

There is no defense against adverse fortune which is so effectual as an habitual sense of humor

Humor is our way of defending ourselves from lifes absurdities by thinking absurdly about them

Common sense and a sense of humor are the same thing moving at different speeds A sense of humor is just common sense dancing

There is always something to chuckle about Sometimes we see it Sometimes we dont Still the world is filled with humor It is there when we are happy and it is there to cheer us up when we are not

Joy is the most infallible sign of the Presence of God

Listen to the clues The next time you feel real joy stop and think Pay attention Because joy is the universes way of knocking on your minds door Hello in there Is anyone home Can I leave a message Yes Good I The message is that you are happy and that means that you are in touch with your purpose

Joy of life seems to me to arise from a sense of being where one belongs of being foursquare with the life we have chosen All the discontented people I know are trying sedulously to be something they are not to do something they cannot do

When we align our thoughts emotions and actions with the highest part of ourselves we are filled with enthusiasm purpose and meaning We are joyously and intimately engaged with our world This is the experience of authentic power

We have a tendency to obscure the forest of simple joys with the trees of problems

People need joy quite as much as clothing Some of them need it far more

When large numbers of people share their joy in common the happiness of each is greater because each adds fuel to the others flame

Joys divided are increased

You increase your joy by increasing the pure joy of others

Joy increases as you give it and diminishes as you try to keep it for yourself In giving it you will accumulate a deposit of joy greater than you ever believed possible

As you express joy you draw it out of those you meet creating joyful people and joyful events The greater the joy you express the more joy you experience

When we feel joyful euphoric happy we are more open to life more capable of seeing things clearly and handling daily tensions

If we could learn how to balance rest against effort calmness against strain quiet against turmoil we would assure ourselves of joy in living and psychological health for life

Simplicity clarity singleness these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy

Joy is not in things it is in us

Joy is the feeling of grinning on the inside

Joy is the will which labors which overcomes obstacles which knows triumph

It is in the compelling zest of high adventure and of victory and in creative action that man finds his supreme joy

I believe humans were born to have joy and to have it more abundantly that the birthright of everyone is loving caring sharing and abundance

Joy is your birthright

Blessed are the joymakers

Although a lot can be learned from adversity most of the same lessons can be learned through laughter and joy

So when youre lonely or sad or bad or blue remember where laughters hiding its hiding inside of YOU

Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand

In every job relationship or life situation there is inevitably some turbulence Learn to laugh at it It is part of what you do and who you are

Laughter puts your brain your central nervous system and your whole being into a state of free play

Laughing deeply is living deeply

It has always seemed to me that hearty laughter is a good way to jog internally without having to go outdoors

A good belly laugh is like taking your liver for a horseback ride

He laughs best whose laugh lasts

Shared laughter is like throwing open the shutters in a gloomy room and letting in fresh air and sunshine

Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human race

Shared laughter is love made audible

A good laugh helps us recognize how ridiculous it is to get excited about matters that are often trivial

Laughter is the brush that sweeps away the cobwebs of the heart

The hours I spent with thee dear heart Are as a string of pearls to me I could them over every one apart My rosary my rosary

And love is loveliest when embalmd in tears

Men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love

Ay me for aught that I ever could read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth

Give me my Romeo and when he shall die Take him and cut him out in little stars And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun

Whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God

Love sought is good but given unsought is better

The fickleness of the woman I love is equalled by the infernal constancy of the women who love me

Love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave

Many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it

Blue eyes say Love me or I die black eyes say Love me or I kill thee

To love her was a liberal education

Some pray to marry the man they love My prayer will somewhat vary I humbly pray to Heaven above That I love the man I marry

Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all

Im sorry that I spelld the word I hate to go above you Because the brown eyes lower fell Because you see I love you

Werther had a love for Charlotte Such as words could never utter Would you know how first he met her She was cutting bread and butter

Love in its essence is spiritual fire

Luck is everything My good luck in life was to be a really frightened person Im fortunate to be a coward to have a low threshold of fear because a hero couldnt make a good suspense film

Most of life is choices and the rest is pure dumb luck

Exceptional talent does not always win its reward unless favoured by exceptional circumstances

I would rather have a lucky general than a smart general They win battles and they make me lucky

There is a spirit and a need and a man at the beginning of every great human advance Every one of these must be right for that particular moment of history or nothing happens

Everything in life is luck

Tis mans to fight but Heavens to give success

I am persuaded that luck and timing have in my case been very important

I have been extraordinarily lucky Anyone who pretends that some kind of luck isnt involved in his success is deluding himself

Tis better to be fortunate than wise

I wish I could tell you that the Childrens Television Workshop and Sesame Street were thanks to my genius but it really was a lucky break

In the queer mess of human destiny the determining factor is luck

Much of my good fortune was a matter of nothing more clever on my part than luck

Name the greatest of all inventors Accident

Though men pride themselves on their great actions often they are not the result of any great design but of chance

No writer should minimize the factor that affects everyone but is beyond control luck

Everything that happened to me happened by mistake I dont believe in fate Its luck timing and accident

Luck always seems to be against the man who depends on it

The doors we open and close each day decide the lives we live

Good luck is often with the man who doesnt include it in his plans

Depend on the rabbits foot if you will but it didnt work for the rabbit

Destiny is the invention of the cowardly and the resigned

This world is run with far too tight a rein for luck to interfere Fortune sells her wares she never gives them In some form or other we pay for her favors or we go empty away

Foolish indeed are those who trust to fortune

Luck enters into every contingency You are a fool if you forget itand a greater fool if you count upon it

They who await no gifts from chance have conquered fate

The worst cynicism a belief in luck

To believe in luck is skepticism

Shallow men believe in luck wise and strong men in cause and effect

Those who trust to chance must abide by the results of chance

Luck is what a capricious man believes in

Luck serves as rationalization for every people that is not master of its own destiny

It is a madness to make fortune the mistress of events because in herself she is nothing but is ruled by prudence

Luck is a word devoid of sense nothing can exist without a cause

Woe to him who would ascribe something like reason to Chance and make a religion of surrendering to it

Fortune is the rod of the weak and the staff of the brave

The man who is intent on making the most of his opportunities is too busy to bother about luck

Luck implies an absolute absence of any principle

Im hardnosed about luck I think it sucks Yeah if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter and then one day somebody gives you a job you can say Gee I was lucky I happened to go up there today But dammit I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years If youre persistent in trying and doing and working you almost make your own fortune

I resolved to take Fate by the throat and shake the living out of her

I must have something to engross my thoughts some object in life which will fill this vacuum and prevent this sad wearing away of the heart

To wait for someone else or to expect someone else to make my life richer or fuller or more satisfying puts me in a constant state of suspension

The champion makes his own luck

It is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck even while waiting for it

I was thinking of my patients and how the worst moment for them was when they discovered they were masters of bad or good luck When they could no longer blame fate they were in despair

Some are satisfied to stand politely before the portals of Fortune and to await her bidding better those who push forward who employ their enterprise who on the wings of their worth and valor seek to embrace luck and to effectively gain her favor

Chance never helps those who do not help themselves

Failure and success seem to have been allotted to men by their stars But they retain the power of wriggling of fighting with their star or against it and in the whole universe the only really interesting movement is this wriggle

Go and wake up your luck

People make their own luck

When it comes time to do your own life you either perpetuate your childhood or you stand on it and finally kick it out from under

If fate means you to lose give him a good fight anyhow

I was forced to live far beyond my years when just a child now I have reversed the order and I intend to remain young indefinitely

We create our fate every day most of the ills we suffer from are directly traceable to our own behavior

Of course fortune has its part in human affairs but conduct is really much more important

You dont just luck into things You build step by step whether its friendships or opportunities

I got well by talking Death could not get a word in edgewise grew discouraged and traveled on

You are in the drivers seat of your life and can point your life down any road you want to travel You can go as fast or as slow as you want to go and you can change the road youre on at any time

We must master our good fortune or it will master us

Im a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work the more I have of it

Good luck needs no explanation

Luck means the hardships and privations which you have not hesitated to endure the long nights you have devoted to work Luck means the appointments you have never failed to keep the trains you have never failed to catch

Luck is what you have left over after you give ioo percent

Luck is not chance its toil fortunes expensive smile is earned

The lucky fellow is the plucky fellow who has been burning midnight oil and taking defeat after defeat with a smile

There is no such thing as making the miracle happen spontaneously and on the spot Youve got to work

I dont know anything about luck Ive never banked on it and Im afraid of people who do Luck to me is something else hard work and realizing what is opportunity and what isnt

Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose As a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck

I dont believe in luck We make our own good fortune

You have to learn the rules of the game And then you have to play better than anyone else

Luck is the byproduct of busting your fanny

When you work seven days a week fourteen hours a day you get lucky

The more you invest in a marriage the more valuable it becomes

Love doesnt just sit there like a stone it has to be made like bread remade all the time made new

No man ever wetted clay and then left it as if there would be bricks by chance and fortune

Some people go through life trying to find out what the world holds for them only to find out too late that its what they bring to the world that really counts

Pennies do not come from heaven they have to be earned here on earth

Its hard to detect good luckit looks so much like something youve earned

Chance favors those in motion

Work and acquire and thou hast chained the wheel of Chance

Superiority to fate is difficult to gain tis not conferred of any but possible to earn

Some folk want their luck buttered

Diligence is the mother of good luck and God gives all things to industry

Fortune is ever seen accompanying industry

I find Im luckier when I work harder

Good luck is a lazy mans estimate of a workers success

Throw a lucky man into the sea and he will come up with a fish in his mouth

As illluck would have it

A pound of pluck is worth a ton of luck

Behind bad luck comes good luck

Hush my dear lie still and slumber Holy angels guard thy bed Heavenly blessings without number Gently falling on thy head

Rockabye baby on the tree top When the wind blows the cradle will rock When the bough breaks the cradle will fall Down will come baby cradle and all

Sweet and low sweet and low Wind of the western sea Low low breathe and blow Wind of the western sea Over the rolling waters go Come from the dying moon and blow Blow him again to me While my little one while my pretty one sleeps

Peter said Ananias why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost And Ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost

And after all what is a lie Tis but The truth in masquerade

A liar is not believed even though he tell the truth

Any fool can tell the truth but it requires a man of some sense to know how to lie well

Terminological inexactitude

A good memory is needed once we have lied

Show me a liar and I will show thee a thief

Who dares think one thing and another tell My heart detests him as the gates of hell

The liars punishment is not in the least that he is not believed but that he cannot believe anyone else

That a lie which is half a truth is ever the blackest of lies That a lie which is all a lie may be met and fought with outright But a lie which is part a truth is a harder matter to fight

A tool is but the extension of a mans hand and a machine is but a complex tool He that invents a machine augments the power of a man and the well being of mankind

Man is a toolusing animal

One machine can do the work of fifty ordinary men No machine can do the work of one extraordinary man

Men have become the tools of their tools

Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels

Mark the perfect man and behold the upright

Quit yourselves like men

A man after his own heart

What a piece of work is a man how noble in reason how infinite in faculty in form and moving how express and admirable in action how like an angel in apprehension how like a god the beauty of the world the paragon of animals And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust man delights not me no nor woman neidier though by your smiling you seem to say so

Man is a social animal

He was a man take him for all in all I shall not look upon his like again

The desire to take medicine is perhaps the greatest feature which distinguishes man from animals

The doctor if he forgets he is only the assistant to nature and zealously takes over the stage may so add to what nature is already doing well that he actually throws the patient into shock by the vigour he adds to natures forces

The practice of medicine is a thinkers art the practice of surgery a plumbers

Every surgeon carries about him a little cemetery in which from time to time he goes to pray a cemetery of bitterness and regret of which he seeks the reason for certain of his failures

Symptoms then are in reality nothing but the cry from suffering organs

I observe the physician with the same diligence as the disease

The very first requirement in a hospital is that it should do the sick no harm

One of the first duties of the physician is to educate the masses not to take medicine

I was sick and ye visited me

There is a great difference between a good physician and a bad one yet very little between a good one and none at all

Nature time and patience are the three great physicians

So many come to the sickroom thinking of themselves as men of science fighting disease and not as healers with a little knowledge helping nature to get a sick man well

In my youth once when I had a really exquisite toothache I suddenly realized that my tooth had temporarily become the centre of the universe that its outcries were more important than anything else and that I would do absolutely anything to placate it And as one gets older and starts worrying about cancer one becomes more and more conscious of the fragility of the whole body and with that consciousness comes a new and degrading kind of fear It is degrading because it strengthens the desire to survive on any terms and the desire to survive on any terms is the most base of all our instincts

If a man thinks about his physical or moral state he usually discovers that he is ill

What is dangerous about tranquillizers is that whatever peace of mind they bring is packaged peace of mind Where you buy a pill and buy peace with it you get conditioned to cheap solutions instead of deep ones

The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth

So long as the body is affected through the mind no audacious device even of the most manifestly dishonest character can fail of producing occasional good to those who yield to it an implicit or even a partial faith

Tranquillizers do not change our environment nor do they change our personalities They merely reduce our responsiveness to stimuli They dull the keen edge of the angers fears or anxiety with which we might otherwise react to the problems of living Once the response has been dulled the irritating surface noise of living muted or eliminated the spark and brilliance are also gone

I am in a moment of pretty wellness

Health is the thing that makes you feel that now is the best time of the year

When you hear hoofbeats think of horses before zebras

The American Medical Association operating from a platform of negative vigilance presents no solutions but busily fights each change and then loudly supports it against the next proposal

When we are sick our virtues and our vices are in abeyance

Most things get better by themselves Most things in fact are better by morning

In medicine sins of commission are mortal sins of omission venial

It is the duty of a doctor to prolong life and it is not his duty to prolong the act of dying

I came I saw I concurred

Disease often tells its secrets in a casual parenthesis

The physician heals Nature makes well

Nature time and patience are the three great physicians

The best doctor is the one you run for and cant find

I find the medicine worse than the malady

An apple a day keeps the doctor away

God heals and the doctor takes the fee

Hes the best physician that knows the worthlessness of the most medicines

Each day the world is born anew for him who takes it rightly

It is a common experience that a problem difficult at night is resolved in the morning after the committee of sleep has worked on it

Each day is a new life Seize it Live it

We sail at sunrise daily outward bound

Always begin anew with the day just as nature does It is one of the sensible things that nature does

With each sunrise we start anew

I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day a fresh try one more start with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning

Relying on God has to begin all over again every day as if nothing had yet been done

Have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew

Each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death

I love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much I can accomplish

Whether one is twenty forty or sixty whether one has succeeded failed or just muddled along whether yesterday was full of sun or storm or one of those dull days with no weather at all life begins each morning Each morning is the open door to a new worldnew vistas new aims new tryings

To be seeing the world made new every morning as if it were the morning of the first day and then to make the most of it for the individual soul as if each were the last day is the daily curriculum of the minds desire

Do not say It is morning and dismiss it with a name of yesterday See it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name

God had infinite time to give us He cut it up into a near succession of new mornings and with each therefore a new idea new inventions and new applications

We are new every day

No matter how big or soft or warm your bed is you still have to get out of it

Spill not the morning the quintessence of the day in recreations for sleep is a recreation Add not therefore sauce to sauce Pastime like wine is poison in the morning It is then good husbandry to sow the head which hath lain fallow all night with some serious work

Do not shorten the morning by getting up late look upon it as the quintessence of life and to a certain extent sacred

Let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate

Hed jolt up in bed every morning sit quietly for a moment and you could feel those wheels spinning in his mind as he planned his day Then hed hit the floor almost on the run

Clay lies still but bloods a rover Breaths a ware that will not keep Up lad when the journeys over Therell be time enough to sleep

Even if a farmer intends to loaf he gets up in time to get an early start

Wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving

I thank You God for this most amazing day for the leaping greenly spirits of trees and a blue true dream of sky and for everything which is natural which is infinite which is yes

I get up and I bless the light thin clouds and the first twittering of birds and the breathing air and smiling face of the hills

Im a most lucky and thankful woman Lucky and thankful for each morning I wake up For three wonderful daughters and one son For an understanding and very loving husband with whom Ive shared fiftytwo blessed years all in good health

If God adds another day to our life let us receive it gladly

Here we stand between two eternities of darkness What are we to do with this glory while it is still ours

Your morning thoughts may determine your conduct for the day Optimistic thoughts will make your day bright and productive while pessimistic thinking will make it dull and wasteful Face each day cheerfully smilingly and courageously and it will naturally follow that your work will be a real pleasure and progress will be a delightful accomplishment

You should always know when youre shifting gears in life You should leave your era it should never leave you

The first thing each morning and the last thing each night suggest to yourself specific ideas that you wish to embody in your character and personality Address such suggestions to yourself silently or aloud until they are deeply impressed upon your mind

Everyday ask yourself the question Do I want to experience Peace of Mind or do I want to experience Conflict

It was only a sunny smile And little it cost in the giving But like morning light it scattered the night And made the day worth living

To get up each morning with the resolve to be happy is to set our own conditions to the events of each day To do this is to condition circumstances instead of being conditioned by them

Today is a new day You will get out of it just what you put into it If you have made mistakes even serious mistakes there is always another chance for you And supposing you have tried and failed again and again you may have a fresh start any moment you choose for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down

When you rise in the morning form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature

As soon as you open your eyes in the morning you can square away for a happy and successful day Its the mood and the purpose at the inception of each day that are the important facts in charting your course for the day We can always square away for a fresh start no matter what the past has been

This is the beginning of a new day God has given me this day to use as I will I can waste it or use it for good but what I do today is important because I am exchanging a day of my life for it When tomorrow comes this day will be gone forever leaving in its place something that I have traded for it I want it to be gain and not loss good and not evil success and not failure in order that I shall not regret the price I have paid for it

I think in terms of the days resolutions not the years

Every new day begins with possibilities Its up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace

Here hath been dawning another blue day think wilt thou let it slip useless away

Be pleasant until ten oclock in the morning and the rest of the day will take care of itself

Today a thousand doors of enterprise are open to you inviting you to useful work To live at this time is an inestimable privilege and a sacred obligation devolves upon you to make right use of your opportunities Today is the day in which to attempt and achieve something worthwhile

Get out of bed forcing a smile You may not smile because you are cheerful but if you will force yourself to smile youll be cheerful because you smile Repeated experiments prove that when man assumes the facial expression of a given mental mood any given mood then that mental mood itself will follow

He who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows that plan carries thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life

A man without a plan for the day is lost before he starts

Never be afraid to sit awhile and think

Only the thinking man lives his life the thoughtless mans life passes him by

My credo is etched on my mirror in my bathroom and I see it when I brush my teeth in the morning It says Dont worry Be Happy Feel Good When you see that first thing and you reflect on it the rest of the day seems to glide by pretty well

Only that day dawns to which we are awake

The day returns and brings us the petty round of irritating concerns and duties Help us to play the man help us to perform them with laughter and kind faces let cheerfulness abound with industry Give us to go blithely on our business all this day bring us to our resting beds weary and content and undishonored and grant us in the end the gift of sleep

A day dawns quite like other days in it a single hour comes quite like other hours but in that day and in that hour the chance of a lifetime faces us

One never knows what each day is going to bring The important thing is to be open and ready for it

Great opportunities come to all but many do not know they have met them The only preparation to take advantage of them is to watch what each day brings

There will be something anguish or elation that is peculiar to this day alone I rise from sleep and say Hail to the morning Come down to me my beautiful unknown

The sun is new each day

Someday the sun is going to shine down on me in some faraway place

With every rising of the sun think of your life as just begun

I feel very happy to see the sun come up every day I feel happy to be around I like to take this day any dayand go to town with it

Look to the East where up the lucid sky The morning climbs The day shall yet be fair

Each golden sunrise ushers in new opportunities for those who retain faith in themselves and keep their chins up Meet the sunrise with confidence Fill every golden minute with right thinking and worthwhile endeavor Do this and there will be joy for you in each golden sunset

Today a new sun rises for me everything lives everything is animated everything seems to speak to me of my passion everything invites me to cherish it

What humbugs we are who pretend to live for Beauty and never see the Dawn

Sunrise days great progenitor

Put yourself in competition with yourself each day Each morning look back upon your work of yesterday and then try to beat it

The morning has gold in its mouth

Do you know what the greatest test is Do you still get excited about what you do when you get up in the morning

Oft when the white still dawn lifted the skies and pushed the hills apart I have felt it like a glory in my heart

Sometimes I have believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast

The mind is found most acute and most uneasy in the morning Uneasiness is indeed a species of sagacitya passive sagacity Fools are never uneasy

Days sweetest moments are at dawn

All flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust

Oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud Like a fastflitting meteor a fastflying cloud A flash of the lightning a break of the wave He passes from life to his rest in the grave

The mother of all living

Shes somebodys mother boys you know For all shes aged and poor and slow

A mother is a mother still The holiest thing alive

Men are what their mothers made them

What is home without a mother

There is none In all this cold and hollow world no fount Of deep strong deathless love save that within A mothers heart

If I were hanged on the highest hill Mother o mine O mother o mine I know whose love would follow me still Mother o mine O mother o mine

All that I am or hope to be I owe to my angel mother

I arose a mother in Israel

The bravest battle that ever was fought Shall I tell you where and when On the maps of the world you will find it not It was fought by the mothers of men

Who ran to help me when I fell And would some pretty story tell Or kiss the place to make it well My Mother

For the hand that rocks the cradle Is the hand that rules the world

Sure I love the dear silver that shines in your hair And the brow thats all furrowed and wrinkled with care I kiss the dear fingers so toilworn for me Oh God bless you and keep you Mother Machree

Her children arise up and call her blessed

I found out why cats drink out of the toilet My mother told me its because its cold in there And Im like How did my mother know that

The most remarkable thing about my mother is that for thirty years she served the family nothing but leftovers The original meal has never been found

What makes life dreary is want of motive

They never die who have the future in them

As long as I have a want I have a reason for living Satisfaction is death

One must not lose desires They are mighty stimulants to creativeness to love and to long life

Take away the cause and the effect ceases

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

The secret of discipline is motivation When a man is sufficiently motivated discipline will take care of itself

Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great

We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves we desire to live an imaginary life in the minds of others and for this purpose we endeavor to shine

Tis distance lends enchantment to the view And robes the mountain in its azure hue

To make a mountain of a molehill

If the mountain wont come to Mohammed Mohammed must go to the mountain

The mountain was in labour and Jove was afraid but it brought forth a mouse

Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted

By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept Remembering thee

He mourns the dead who lives as they desire

The mouse that hath but one hole is quickly taken

If a man write a better book preach a better sermon or make a better mousetrap than his neighbor though he build his house in the woods the world will make a beaten path to his door

Murder most foul as in the best it is But this most foul strange and unnatural

For murder though it have no tongue will speak With most miraculous organ

Beethoven can write music thank God but he can do nothing else on earth

The public doesnt want new music the main thing that it demands of a composer is that he be dead

I have sat through an Italian opera til for sheer pain and inexplicable anguish I have rushed out into the noisiest places of the crowded street to solace myself with sounds which I was not obliged to follow and get rid of the distracting torment of endless fruitless barren attention

Let us not forget that the greatest composers were also the greatest thieves They stole from everyone and everywhere

A legend is an old man with a cane known for what he used to do

A symphony is a stage play with the parts written for instruments instead of for actors

An ear for music is very different from a taste for music I have no ear whatever I could not sing an air to save my life but I have the intensest delight in music and can detect good from bad

Classic music is th kind that we keep thinkinll turn into a tune

Discord occasions a momentary distress to the ear which remains unsatisfied and even uneasy until it hears something better

Discord occasions a momentary distress to the ear which remains unsatisfied and even uneasy until it hears something better I am convincedthat provided the ear be at length made amends there are few dissonances too strong for it Disharmony to paraphrase Bergsons statement about disorder is simply a harmony to which many are unaccustomed

Canned music is like audible wallpaper

Dont play whats there play whats not there

From Mozart I learnt to say important things in a conversational way

Generally music feedeth that disposition of the spirits which it findeth

God tells me how he wants the music played and you get in his way

Handel was a man of the world but Bach was a world of a man

He was dying all his life

I am sure my music has a taste of codfish in it

I do not mind what language an opera is sung in so long as it is the language I dont understand

In the Negro melodies of America I find all that is needed for a great and noble school of music

It is the best of all trades to make songs and the second best to sing them

Jazz came to America 300 years ago in chains

Jazz is about the only form of art existing today in which there is freedom of the individual without the loss of group contact

Jazz is the only music in which the same note can be played night after night but differently each time

Jazz will endure just as long as people hear it through their feet instead of their brains

Mozart is sunshine

Music sweeps by me as a messenger carrying a message that is not for me

Mozarts music gives us permission to live

Music is a strange thing I would almost say it is a miracle For it stands halfway between thought and phenomenon between spirit and matter

Music is another planet

Music is the art of thinking with sounds

Music is well said to be the speech of angels

Music touches places beyond our touching

Music with dinner is an insult both to the cook and the violinist

Never compose anything unless the not composing of it becomes a positive nuisance to you

Nothing is better than music It has done more for us than we have the right to hope for

Rests always sound well

Swans sing before they die twere no bad thing did certain persons die before they sing

The basic difference between classical music and jazz is that in the former the music is always graver than its performance whereas the way jazz is performed is always more important than what is being played

The devil does not stay where music is

The Sonata is an essentially dramatic art form combining the emotional range in vivid presentation of a fullsize stage drama with the terseness of a short story

The sonatas of Mozart are unique they are too easy for children and too difficult for artists

Too many pieces of music finish too long after the end

Throughout my career nervousness and stagefright have never left me before playing And each of the thousands of concerts I have played at I feel as bad as I did the very first time

Twelve Highlanders and a bagpipe make a rebellion

Wagner has lovely moments but awful quarters of an hour

Who is there that in logical words can express the effect music has on us A kind of inarticulate unfathomable speech which leads us to the edge of the Infinite and lets us for moments gaze into that

You know what you do when you shit singing is the same thing only up

After silence that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music

When people hear good music it makes them homesick for something they never had and never will have

Light quirks of music broken and uneven make the soul dance upon a jig of heaven

Who hears music feels his solitude peopled at once

Richard Wagner a musician who wrote music which is better than it sounds

One cannot judge Lohengrin from a first hearing and I certainly do not intend to hear it a second time

He could fiddle all the bugs off a sweetpotato vine

Opera purges men of those hesitations and worries which make it difficult for them to acknowledge their importance to themselves A good performance of an opera that is provides a language for us to speak of ourselves as we have always known we should speak

No one can any longer write in the fat style of Strauss That was killed by Stravinsky He stripped the body of much of its clothes Music is the craft of building structures with sound and that is what Stravinsky represents

A nation creates music the composer only arranges it

Sentimentally I am disposed to harmony but organically I am incapable of a tune

Music produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without

Conductors must give unmistakable and suggestive signals to the orchestra not choreography to the audience

Music is the shorthand of emotion

For most singers the first half of the career involves extending ones repertoire the second half trimming it

How wonderful opera would be if there were no singers

Opera in English is in the main just about as sensible as baseball in Italian

Music is only sound expressing certain patterns so to what extent is that sound architecture and to what extent theatre

A jazz musician is a juggler who uses harmonies instead of oranges

Music is a language by whose means messages are elaborated that such messages can be understood by the many but sent out only by few and that it alone among all the languages unites the contradictory character of being at once intelligible and untranslatable these facts make the creator of music a being like the gods

Music is your own experience your thoughts your wisdom If you dont live it it wont come out of your horn

The good composer is slowly discovered the bad composer is slowly found out

The function of pop music is to be consumed

Oboe an ill woodwind that nobody blows good

Music first and last should sound well should allure and enchant the ear Never mind the inner significance

I am tired before the concert not afterward

Music the greatest good that mortals know and all of heaven we have below

What we play is life

I know that the twelve notes in each octave and the varieties of rhythm offer me opportunities that all of human genius will never exhaust

Had I learned to fiddle I should have done nothing else

The notes I handle no better than many pianists But the pauses between the notes ah that is where the art resides

Chamber music a conversation between friends

Mozart is the human incarnation of the divine force of creation

I write as a sow piddles

I am an arrogant and impatient listener but in the case of a few composers a very few when I hear a work I do not like I am convinced that it is my own fault Verdi is one of those composers

Music hath charms to soothe a savage breast to soften rocks or bend a knotted oak

Harpists spend half their life tuning and the other half playing out of tune

She was an aging singer who had to take every note above A with her eyebrows

Going to the opera like getting drunk is a sin that carries its own punishment with it and that a very severe one

Opera is when a guy gets stabbed in the back and instead of bleeding he sings

I think popular music in this country is one of the few things in the twentieth century that have made giant strides in reverse

If a literary man puts together two words about music one of them will be wrong

Music is given to us specifically to make order of things to move from an anarchic individualistic state to a regulated perfectly concious one which alone insures vitality and durability

Music should strike fire from the heart of man and bring tears from the eyes of woman

Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast

Soprano basso even the contralto Wished him five fathom under the Rialto

Music is well said to be the speech of angels

Why should the devil have all the good tunes

The musician who always plays on the same string is laughed at

Music is the universal language of mankind

All of heaven we have below

Such sweet compulsion doth in music lie

The harp that once through Taras halls The soul of music shed Now hangs as mute on Taras walls As if that soul were fled

Wagners music is better than it sounds

Light quirks of music broken and uneven Make the soul dance upon a jig to Heavn

The man that hath no music in himself Nor is no moved with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils

Hell is full of musical amateurs

There was the door to which I found no key There was the veil through which 1 might not see

There be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which I know not the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid

Mystery is the wisdom of blockheads

Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me

Father calls me William sister calls me Will Mother calls me Willie but the fellows call me Bill

Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field

And lo Ben Adhems name led all the rest

He left the name at which the world grew pale To point a moral or adorn a tale

A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches

I cannot tell what the dickens his name is

But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed

Whats in a name that which we call a rose By any other name would smell as sweet

Nationalism is an infantile disease It is the measles of mankind

Born in inquity and conceived in sin the spirit of nationalism has never ceased to bend human institutions to the service of dissension and distress

The course of nature is the art of God

After a debauch of thundershower the weather takes the pledge and signs it with a rainbow

From the intrinsic evidence of His creation the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathematician

Is dishwater dull Naturalists with microscopes have told me that it teems with quiet fun

It is not necessarily those lands which are the most fertile or most favored climate that seem to me the happiest but those in which a long stroke of adaptation between man and his environment has brought out the best qualities of both

Like a gardener I believe that what goes down must come up

Nature is a catchment of sorrows

Nature is not humanhearted

Nature with equal mind sees all her sons at play sees man control the wind the wind sweep man away

The chessboard is the world the pieces are the phenomena of the universe the rules of the game are what we call the Laws of Nature The player on the other side is hidden from us We know that his play is always fair just and patient But also we know to our cost that he never overlooks a mistake or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance

The sky is the daily bread of the eyes

The unnatural that too is natural

There is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory

There is something haunting in the light of the moon it has all the dispassionateness of a disembodied soul and something of its inconceivable mystery

The universe is not hostile nor yet is it friendly It is simply indifferent

In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments there are consequences

Monotony is the law of nature Look at the monotonous manner in which the sun rises The monotony of necessary occupations is exhilarating and lifegiving

Men argue nature acts

Nature is usually wrong

Speak to the earth and it shall teach thee

Flowers have an expression of countenance as much as men or animals Some seem to smile some have a sad expression some are pensive and diffident others again are plain honest and upright

Gie me a spark o natures fire thats a the learning I desire

Light may be shed on man and his origins

I have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term natural selection

The expression often used by Mr Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the fittest is more accurate and is sometimes equally convenient

Nature is reckless of the individual When she has points to carry she carries them

I wanted to say something about the universe Theres God angels plants and horseshit

When elephants fight it is the grass that suffers

The dinosaurs eloquent lesson is that if some bigness is good an overabundance of bigness is not necessarily better

Who are we We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people

A vacuum is a hell of a lot better than some of the stuff that nature replaces it with

We cannot command Nature except by obeying her

The mastery of nature is vainly believed to be an adequate substitute for selfmastery

Nature thrives on patience man on impatience

The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free

What mighty battles have I seen and heard waged between the trees and the west wind an Iliad fought in the fields of air

Grass is the forgiveness of nature her constant benediction Forests decay harvests perish flowers vanish but grass is immortal

I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest snow to keep an appointment with a beech tree or a yellow birch or an old acquaintance among the pines

The whole of nature is a conjugation of the verb to eat in the active and passive

The universe is like a safe to which there is a combination but the combination is locked up in the safe

When the oak is felled the whole forest echoes with its fall but a hundred acorns are sown in silence by an unnoticed breeze

Deep in their roots all flowers keep the light

By natures kindly disposition most questions which it is beyond mans power to answer do not occur to him at all

To demand sense is the hallmark of nonsense Nature does not make sense Nothing makes sense

The bluebird carries the sky on his back

There is nothing in which the birds differ more from man than the way in which they can build and yet leave a landscape as it was before

The greatest joy in nature is the absence of man

When a man wantonly destroys a work of man we call him a vandal when a man destroys one of the works of God we call him a sportsman

Man is a complex being he makes deserts bloom and lakes die

Nature never did betray the heart that loved her

Gods miracles are to be found in nature itself the wind and waves the wood that becomes a tree all of these are explained biologically but behind them is the hand of God

When I first open my eyes upon the morning meadows and look out upon the beautiful world I thank God I am alive

If you wish to know the divine feel the wind on your face and the warm sun on your hand

The radiance in some places is so great as to be fairly dazzling every crystal every flower a window opening into heaven a mirror reflecting the Creator

Nature is too thin a screen the glory of the omnipresent God bursts through everywhere

I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journeywork of the stars

Look deep deep into nature and then you will understand everything better

Come forth into the light of things Let nature be your teacher

If you watch how nature deals with adversity continually renewing itself you cant help but learn

Rivers and rocks and trees have always been talking to us but weve forgotten how to listen

Speak to the earth and it shall teach thee

Adopt the pace of nature her secret is patience

Climb the mountains and get their good tidings Natures peace will flow into you as sunshine into flowers the winds will blow their freshness into you and the storms their energy and cares will drop off like autumn leaves

Nature tops the list of potent tranquilizers and stress reducers The mere sound of moving water has been shown to lower blood pressure

The sun my almighty physician

Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns so each small piece of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry

The finest workers in stone are not copper or steel tools but the gentle touches of air and water working at their leisure with a liberal allowance of time

To the dull mind all nature is leaden To the illumined mind the whole world burns and sparkles with light

The beauty of the world and the orderly arrangement of everything celestial makes us confess that there is an excellent and eternal nature which ought to be worshiped and admired by all mankind

In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous

The sun gives us light but the moon provides inspiration If you look at the sun without shielding your eyes youll go blind If you look at the moon without covering your eyes youll become a poet

The world is full of poetry The air is living with its spirit and the waves dance to the music of its melodies and sparkle in its brightness

The sky is the daily bread of the eyes

My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky

The bluebird carries the sky on his back

The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness

We lose our souls if we lose the experience of the forest the butterflies the song of the birds if we cant see the stars at night

Forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair

As long as the Earth can make a spring every year I can As long as the Earth can flower and produce nurturing fruit I can because Im the Earth I wont give up until the Earth gives up

The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn

I never knew how soothing trees are many trees and patches of open sunlight and tree presences it is almost like having another being

Nature is saturated with deity

Our Lord has written the promise of resurrection not in books alone but in every leaf of springtime

The nicest thing about the promise of spring is that sooner or later shell have to keep it

Spring is natures way of saying Lets party

It was one of those perfect summer days the sun was shining a breeze was blowing the birds were singing and the lawnmower was broken

Nobody sees a flower really it is so small it takes time we havent time and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time

Consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these

The AmenT of Nature is always a flower

Next time a sunrise steals your breath or a meadow of flowers leave you speechless remain that way Say nothing and listen as heaven whispers Do you like it I did it just for you

Every flower is a soul blossoming in Nature

Flowers always make people better happier and more helpful they are sunshine food and medicine to the soul

Earth laughs in flowers

God Almighty first planted a garden And indeed it is the purest of human pleasures

Pleasure for an hour a bottle of wine pleasure for a year marriage pleasure for a lifetime a garden

The kiss of sun for pardon The song of the birds for mirth One is nearer Gods Heart in a garden Than anywhere else on earth

All gardeners live in beautiful places because they make them so

All gardening is landscape painting

What is a weed A plant whose virtues have not yet been discovered

For many years I was selfappointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully though I never received one cent for it

The next time it begins to rain lie down on your belly nestle your chin into the grass and get a frogseye view of how raindrops fall The sight of hundreds of blades of grass bowing down and popping back up like piano keys strikes me as one of the merriest sights in the world

Sunshine is delicious rain is refreshing wind braces us up snow is exhilarating there is really no such thing as bad weather only different kinds of good weather

Dont knock the weather ninetenths of the people couldnt start a conversation if it didnt change once in a while

After rain comes fair weather

Weather means more when you have a garden Theres nothing like listening to a shower and thinking how it is soaking in around your green beans

This is the day the Lord had made We will rejoice and be glad in it

I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day a fresh try one more start with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning

Whether one is twenty forty or sixty whether one has succeeded failed or just muddled along whether yesterday was full of sun or storm or one of those dull days with no weather at all life begins each morning I

Today a new sun rises for me everything lives everything is animated everything seems to speak to me of my passion everything invites me to cherish it

Every new day begins with possibilities Its up to us to fill it with the things that move us toward progress and peace

I love the challenge of starting at zero every day and seeing how much I can accomplish

Thank God ever morning when you get up that you have something to do which must be done whether you like it or not

Today is a new day You will get out of it just what you put into it If you have made mistakes even serious mistakes there is always another chance for you for this thing that we call failure is not the falling down but the staying down

Finish each day and be done with it You have done what you could some blunders and absurdities have crept in forget them as soon as you can Tomorrow is a new day you shall begin it serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with your old nonsense

Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point Climb slowly steadily enjoying each passing moment and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey

Nothing is worth more than this day

Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year

Normal day let me be aware of the treasure you are Let me learn from you love you bless you before you depart Let me not pass you by in quest of some rare and perfect tomorrow

Yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose

When all else is lost the future still remains

When I look at the future its so bright it burns my eyes

Earths crammed with Heaven And every common bush afire with God

To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms she speaks A various language

I love not man the less but nature more

For Art may err but Nature cannot miss

The woods were made for the hunter of dreams The brooks for the fishes of song

Nature is a volume of which God is the author

Nature like a kind and smiling mother lends herself to our dreams and cherishes our fancies

Accuse not Nature she hath done her part Do thou but thine

Grass is the forgiveness of nature her constant benediction Forests decay harvests perish flowers vanish but grass is immortal

Everything in nature acts in conformity with law

Nature abhors a vacuum

To hold as t were the mirror up to nature

I chatter chatter as I flow To join the brimming river For men may come and men may go But I go on forever

When I would recreate myself I seek the darkest wood the thickest and most interminable and to the citizen most dismal swamp I enter a swamp as a sacred place a sanctum sanctorum There is the strength the marrow of Nature

One touch of nature makes the whole world kin

Nature has always had more force than education

O pilot tis a fearful night Theres danger on the deep

The winds and waves are always on the side of the ablest navigators

Oh I am a cook and a captain bold And the mate of the Nancy brig And a bosun tight and a midshipmate And the crew of the captains gig

Thus I steer my bark and sail On even keel with gentle gale

Hearts of oak are our ships Hearts of oak are our men

Now landsmen all whoever you may be If you want to rise to the top of the tree If your soul isnt fettered to an office stool Be careful to be guided by this golden rule Stick close to your desks and never go to to sea And you may all be Rulers of the Queens Navee

Necessity has no law

Necessity the mother of invention

Necessity is often the spur to genius

Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom It is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves

Necessity makes even the timid brave

Not for myself I make this prayer But for this race of mine That stretches forth from shadowed places Dark hands for bread and wine

The image of God cut in ebony

O black and unknown bards of long ago How came your lips to touch the sacred fire How in your darkness did you come to know The power and beauty of the minstrels lyre

In the Negro countenance you will often meet with strong traits of benignity I have felt yearnings of tenderness towards some of these faces

The best way to uncolor the Negro is to give the white man a white heart

The Negro is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world and he has deep in his heart a passion for all that is splendid rich and fanciful

We can live without our friends but not without our neighbors

When your neighbors house is afire your own property is at stake

Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself

The crop always seems better in our neighbors field and our neighbors cow gives more milk

In the field of world policy I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor

The cold neutrality of an impartial judge

Neutrality as a lasting principle is an evidence of weakness

A wise neuter joins with neither but uses both as his honest interest leads him

The heart is never neutral

A plague o both your houses

A man never tells you anything until you contradict him

Laws die books never

The English never draw a line without blurring it

I like to visit New York but I wouldnt live there if you gave it to me

If there ever was an aviary overstocked with jays it is that YaptownontheHudson called New York

Vulgar of manner overfed Overdressed and underbred Heartless Godless hells delight Rude by day and lewd by night Bedwarfed the man oergrown the brute Ruled by boss and prostitute Purplerobed and pauperclad Raving rotting moneymad A squirming herd in Mammons mesh A wilderness of human flesh Crazed with avarice lust and rum New York thy names Delirium

Spick and span new

What is valuable is not new and what is new is not valuable

If a man bites a dog that is news

By evil report and good report

As cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country

Theres villainous news abroad

When we hear news we should always wait for the sacrament of confirmation

Freedom of the press in Britain is freedom to print such of the proprietors prejudices as the advertisers dont object to

Newspapers have developed what might be called a vested interest in catastrophe If they can spot a fight they play up that fight If they can uncover a tragedy they will headline that tragedy

Everything you read in the newspapers is absolutely true except for that rare story of which you happen to have firsthand knowledge

I do not take a single newspaper nor read one a month and I feel myself infinitely the happier for it

Burke said there were three Estates in Parliament but in the reporters gallery yonder there sat a fourth Estate more important than them all

Comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable

Remember son many a good story has been ruined by oververification

Dont be afraid to make a mistake your readers might like it

One newspaper a day ought to be enough for anyone who still prefers to retain a little mental balance

Journalism is literature in a hurry

The sports page records peoples accomplishments the front page usually records nothing but mans failures

If some great catastrophe is not announced every morning we feel a certain void Nothing in the paper today we sigh

Carelessness is not fatal to journalism nor are cliches for the eye rests lightly on them But what is intended to be read once can seldom be read more than once a journalist has to accept the fact that his work by its very todayness is excluded from any share in tomorrow

He had been kicked in the head by a mule when young and believed everything he read in the Sunday papers

An editor a person employed on a newspaper whose business it is to separate the wheat from the chaff and to see that the chaff is printed

The day you write to please everyone you no longer are in journalism You are in show business

News is the first rough draft of history

It is a newspapers duty to print the news and raise hell

What you see is news what you know is background what you feel is opinion

Freedom of the press is guaranteed only to those who own one

A good newspaper is a nation talking to itself

The first essence of journalism is to know what you want to know the second is to find out who will tell you

Todays reporter is forced to become an educator more concerned with explaining the news than with being first on the scene

A writer who takes up journalism abandons the slow tempo of literature for a faster one and the change will do him harm By degrees the flippancy of journalism will become a habit and the pleasure of being paid on the nail and more especially of being praised on the nail grow indispensable

Newspapers are the worlds mirrors

Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter

Every editor of newspapers pays tribute to the devil

Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets

Let me make the newspapers and I care not what is preached in the pulpit or what is enacted in Congress

AH I know is what I see in the papers

The Night has a thousand eyes The Day but one Yet the light of the bright world dies With the dying sun

For the night Shows stars and women in a better light

Nights black Mantle covers all alike

Watchman what of the night

Night when deep sleep falleth on men

The night cometh when no man can work

And the night shall be filled with music And the cares that infest the day Shall fold their tents like the Arabs And as silently steal away

In a real dark night of the soul it is always three oclock in the morning

The nearer the dawn the darker the night

The night is dark and I am far from home

To all to each a fair good night And pleasing dreams and slumbers light

Making night hideous

It is the hour when from the boughs The nightingales high note is heard It is the hour when lovers vows Seem sweet in every whisperd word

Hark thats the nightingale Telling the selfsame tale Her song told when this ancient earth was young So echoes answered when her song was sung In the first wooded vale

The angel of spring the mellowthroated nightingale

I am not the smartest or most talented person in the world but I succeeded because I keep going and going and going

I know the price of success dedication hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen

Victory belongs to the most persevering

Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed

Success seems to be largely a matter of hanging on after others have let go

If you wish success in life make perseverance your bosom friend

They who are the most persistent and work in the true spirit will invariably be the most successful

If at first you dont succeed try try try again

If at first you dont succeed youre running about average

The secret of success is constancy of purpose

The only way to the top is by persistent intelligent hard work

The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night

I realized early on that success was tied to not giving up Most people in this business gave up and went on to other things If you simply didnt give up you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you

Call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful business giants and if you know anything about their careers you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits Edison went hungry many times before he became famous

Perseverance is a great element of success If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody

Four steps to achievement plan purposefully prepare prayerfully proceed positively pursue persistently

Flaming enthusiasm backed up by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success

Diamonds are only lumps of coal that stuck to their jobs

Persistence is the master virtue Without it there is no other

Im hardnosed about luck I think it sucks Yeah if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter and then one day somebody gives you a job you can say Gee I was lucky I happened to go up there today But dammit I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years If youre persistent in trying and doing and working you almost make your own fortune

Its the plugging away that will win you the day So dont be a piker old pard Just draw on your grit its so easy to quit Its the keeping your chin up thats hard

No one succeeds without effort Those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance

Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting

Be of good cheer Do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow You have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles Remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost

The way to succeed is never quit Thats it But really be humble about it You start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going

Continuous effortsnot strength or intelligenceis the key to unlocking our potential

Plodding wins the race

The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow

Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal my strength lies solely in my tenacity

A winner never quits and a quitter never wins

Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose As a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck

In the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm in the real world all rests on perseverance

Theres such a thin line between winning and losing

It is easier to begin well than to finish well

The great majority of men are bundles of beginnings

I hope I shall have ambition until the day I die

When you put your hand to the plow you cant put it down until you get to the end of the row

Out of the strain of the Doing Into the peace of the Done

Great is the art of beginning but greater is the art of ending

There are two parts to the creative endeavor making something then disseminating it

We rate ability in men by what they finish not by what they begin

A chicken doesnt stop scratching just because worms are scarce

Everyone has his superstitions One of mine has always been when I started to go anywhere or to do anything never to turn back or to stop until the thing intended was accomplished

I just kept on doing what everyone starts out doing The real question is why did other people stop

Men perish because they cannot join the beginning with the end

Business is full of brilliant men who started out with a spurt and lacked the stamina to finish Their places were taken by patient and unshowy plodders who never knew when to quit

I can remember walking as a child It was not customary to say you were fatigued It was customary to complete the goal of the expedition

He that has cut the claws of the lion will not feel quite secure until he has also drawn his teeth

Courage to start and willingness to keep everlasting at it are the requisites for success

I went for years not finishing anything Because of course when you finish something you can be judged I had poems which were rewritten so many times I suspect it was just a way of avoiding sending them out

Let no one til his death be called unhappy Measure not the work Until the days out and the labor done Then bring your gauges

All is well that ends well

Either do not attempt at all or go through with it

In soloingas in other activitiesit is far easier to start something than it is to finish it

It is a matter first of beginningand then following through

Genius begins great works labor alone finishes it

There is but an inch of difference between the cushioned chamber and the padded cell

The only way to find out if you can write is to set aside a certain period every day and try Save enough money to give yourself six months to be a fulltime writer Work every day and the pages will pile up

I work every dayor at least I force myself into my office or room I may get nothing done but you dont earn bonuses without putting in time Nothing may come for three months but you dont earn the fourth without it

When nothing seems to help I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two and I know it was not that blow that did it but all that had gone before

The drops of rain make a hole in the stone not by violence but by oft falling

It does not matter how slowly you go so long as you do not stop

Live with no time out

The great thing in this world is not so much where we are but in what direction we are moving

The race is not always to the swift but to those who keep on running

My parents told me that people will never know how long it takes you to do something They will only know how well it is done

By perseverance the snail reached the Ark

Our desire must be like a slow and stately ship sailing across endless oceans never in search of safe anchorage Then suddenly unexpectedly it will find mooring for a moment

The race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong

If we are facing in the right direction all we have to do is keep on walking

Its the steady constant driving to the goal for which youre striving not the speed with which you travel that will make your victory sure

Im a slow walker but I never walk back

Slow and steady wins the race

Character is built into the spiritual fabric of personality hour by hour day by day year by year in much the same deliberate way that physical health is built into the body

No great thing is created suddenly

Be content to grow a little each day If the improvement is the sort of thing which is very slow do not measure it too often Do a selfcomparison every two weeks or every six months whatever is appropriate

Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it

Wisely and slow They stumble that run fast

Plodding wins the race

The way of progress is neither swift nor easy

One thing at a time all things in succession That which grows slowly endures

Make haste slowly

Slow motion gets you there faster

Im not there yet but Im closer than I was yesterday

Life begins on the other side of despair

I am suffocated and lost when I have not the bright feeling of progression

The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide

You give ioo percent in the first half of the game and if that isnt enough in the second half you give whats left

Dont get hung up on a snag in the stream my dear Snags are not so dangerousits the debris that clings to them that makes the trouble Pull yourself loose and go on

One can go a long way after one is tired

The great thing and the hard thing is to stick to things when you have outlived the first interest and not yet got the second which comes with a sort of mastery

Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit

If something is boring after two minutes try it for four If still boring try for eight sixteen thirtytwo and so on Eventually one discovers that it is not boring but very interesting

No one ever did anything worth doing unless he was prepared to go on with it long after it became something of a bore

Ive been failing for like ten or eleven years When it turns itll turn Right now Im just tryin to squeeze through a very tight financial period get the movie out and put my things in order

In our day when a pitcher got into trouble in a game instead of taking him out our manager would leave him in and tell him to pitch his way out of trouble

Im a little wounded but I am not slain I will lay me down to bleed a while Then Ill rise and fight again

The tragedy of life is not that man loses but that he almost wins

Where I am today has everything to do with the years I spent hanging on to a career by my fingernails

Courage is fear holding on a minute longer

A hero is no braver than an ordinary man but he is brave five minutes longer

Hope says to us constantly go on go on and leads us to the grave

Every great work every big accomplishment has been brought into manifestation through holding to the vision and often just before the big achievement comes apparent failure and discouragement

The line between failure and success is so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it How many a man has thrown up his hands at a time when a little more effort a little more patience would have achieved success A little more persistence a little more effort and what seemed hopeless failure may turn to glorious success

When you get to the end of your rope tie a knot and hang on

It is with enterprises as with striking fire we do not meet with success except with reiterated efforts and often at the instant when we despaired of success

Saints are sinners who kept on going

We can do anything we want to do if we stick to it long enough

When you get into a tight place and everything goes against you til it seems as though you could not hold on a minute longer never give up then for that is just the place and time that the tide will turn

Men do not fail they stop trying

It aint over til its over

Triumph often is nearest when defeat seems inescapable

Dont bother about genius Dont worry about being clever Trust to hard work perseverance and determination And the best motto for a long march is Dont grumble Plug on

Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal while others on the contrary obtain a victory by exerting at the last moment more vigorous efforts than before

Never stop One always stops as soon as something is about to happen

Many of lifes failures are men who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up

Fight one more round When your feet are so tired you have to shuffle back to the center of the ring fight one more round

Dont leave before the miracle happens

If something doesnt come up the way you want you have to forge ahead

Fortune is like the market where many times if you can stay a little the price will fall

This man Wellington is so stupid he does not know when he is beaten and goes on fighting

He never knew when he was whipped so he never was

Entrepreneurs average 38 failures before a final success What sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence There are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat

As long as a person doesnt admit he is defeated he is not defeatedhes just a little behind and isnt through fighting

Only yield when you must never give up the ship but fight on to the last with a stiff upper lip

Defeat never comes to any man until he admits it

There is something in meI just cant stand to admit defeat

There was no such thing as defeat if you didnt accept it

Never give in Never give in Never never never never In nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions or honor and good sense

First there are those who are winners and know they are winners Then there are the losers who know they are losers Then there are those who are not winners but dont know it Theyre the ones for me They never quit trying Theyre the soul of our game

Its not worthy of human beings to give up

Never admit defeat

We shall go on to the end We shall fight in France we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be We shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the halls We shall never surrender

Patient endurance attends to all things

To be somebody you must last

He conquers who endures

Emotional maturity is the ability to stick to a job and to struggle through until it is finished to endure unpleasantness discomfort and frustration

To bear is to conquer our fate

Keep breathing

It helps I think to consider ourselves on a very long journey the main thing is to keep to the faith to endure to help each other when we stumble or tire to weep and press on

The first and final thing you have to do in this world is to last in it and not be smashed by it

The first need of being is endurance to endure with gladness if we can with fortitude in any event

I bend but I do not break

He that endureth to the end shall be saved

Whatever necessity lays upon thee endure whatever she commands do

To be somebody you must last

In the clutch of circumstance I have not winced or cried aloud Under the bludgeoning of chance my head is bloody but unbowed

We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow

Giving up is the ultimate tragedy

God Almighty hates a quitter

Endurance is one of the most difficult disciplines but it is to the one who endures that the final victory comes

Endure and preserve yourselves for better things

Every kind of fortune is to be overcome by bearing it

When we see ourselves in a situation which must be endured and gone through it is best to make up our minds to meet it with firmness and accommodate everything to it in the best way practical This lessons the evil while fretting and fuming only serve to increase your own torments

If you want to see the sun shine you have to weather the storm

If you want the rainbow you gotta put up with the rain

What cannot be altered must be borne not blamed

He that cant endure the bad will not live to see the good

To struggle when hope is banished To live when lifes salt is gone To dwell in a dream thats vanished To endure and go calmly on

A high heart ought to bear calamities and not flee them since in bearing them appears the grandeur of the mind and in fleeing them the cowardice of the heart

Endurance is nobler than strength and patience than beauty

They merit more praise who know how to suffer misery than those who temper themselves with contentment

We must endure what fortune sends

People can bear anything

We must learn from life how to suffer it

This is courage in a man to bear unflinchingly what heaven sends

Man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit

Obstacles cannot crush me every obstacle yields to stern resolve

And let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not

Hold on with a bulldog grip and chew and choke as much as possible

There remain times when one can only endure One lives on one doesnt die and the only thing that one can do is to fill ones mind and time as far as possible with the concerns of other people It doesnt bring immediate peace but it brings the dawn nearer

When I look at the kids training today I can tell which ones are going to do well Its not necessarily the ones who have the most natural talent or who fall the least Sometimes its the kids who fall the most and keep pulling themselves up and trying again

Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising every time we fall

It takes far less courage to kill yourself than it takes to make yourself wake up one more time

Success consists of getting up just one more time than you fall

If I dont get off the mat Ill lose the fight

For a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again

Persistent people begin their success where others end in failure

Think of a fine painter attempting to capture an inner vision beginning with one corner of the canvas painting what he thinks should be there not quite pulling it off covering it over with white paint and trying again each time finding out what his painting isnt until he finally finds out what it is And when you finally do find out what one corner of your vision is youre off and running

Vitality shows not only in the ability to persist but in the ability to start over

Regression in grief must be seen and supported as a means toward adaptation and health

To be happy drop the words if only and substitute instead the words next time

Life is a maze in which we take the wrong turning before we learn to walk

Education is hanging around until youve caught on

Never go to bed mad Stay up and fight

You go back to the gym and you just do it again and again until you get it right

As long as one keeps searching the answers come

How many years you have to keep on doing until you know what to do and how to do

There is no wisdom equal to that which comes after the event

Tolerate the process of coming to knowledge or certainty or clarity through sometimes apparently hopeless thickets of confusion or bewilderment Learn not to be surprised or disheartened by the muddle you inhabit and not to press too soon for a superficial reprieve

Learn to selfconquest persevere thus for a time and you will perceive very clearly the advantage which you gain from it

What can any of us do with his talent but try to develop his vision so that through frequent failures we may learn better what we have missed in the past

All effort is in the last analysis sustained by faith that it is worth making

Competition is easier to accept if you realize it is not an act of oppression or abrasion Ive worked with my best friends in direct competition

Life has no smooth road for any of us and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend over steep ways to the stars fulfills itself

The one who cares the most wins Thats how I knew Id end up with everyone else waving the white flags and not me Thats how I knew Id be the last person standing when it was all over I cared the most

If I had refused to institute a negotiation or had not persevered in it I would have been degraded in my own estimation as a man of honor

I read my own books sometimes to cheer me when it is hard to write and then I remember that it was always difficult and how nearly impossible it was sometimes

The difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one comes from a strong will and the other from a strong wont

When youre a professional you come back no matter what happened the day before

We can do whatever we wish to do provided our wish is strong enough What do you want most to do Thats what I have to keep asking myself in the face of difficulties

Desire and hope will push us on toward the future

The champ may have lost his stuff temporarily or permanently he cant be sure When he can no longer throw his high hard one he throws his heart instead He throws something He just doesnt walk off the mound and weep

We attempt nothing great but from a sense of the difficulties we have to encounter we persevere in nothing great but from a pride in overcoming them

He turns not back who is bound to a star

What helps me go forward is that I stay receptive I feel that anything can happen

There was a Texas Ranger one time who said that theres no stopping a man who knows hes in the right and keeps acoming

When you get to the end of your rope tie a knot in it and hang on

Whatever course you decide upon there is always someone to tell you that you are wrong There are always difficulties arising which tempt you to believe that your critics are right To map out a course of action and follow it to an end requires courage

People with good intentions never give up

If I see a door comin my way Im knockin it down And if I cant knock down the door Im sliding through the window

All my life Ive been competingand competing to win I came to realize that in this way this cancer was the toughest competition I had faced yet I made up my mind that I was going to lick it all the way I not only wasnt going to let it kill me I wasnt even going to let it put me on the shelf

I have accepted fear as a part of lifespecifically the fear of change I have gone ahead despite the pounding in the heart that says turn back

Tribulation produces perseverance and perseverance character and character hope

The unifying of opposites is the eternal process

Brave admiral say but one good word What shall we do when hope is gone The words leapt like a leaping sword Sail on sail on and on

In Hollywood all marriages are happy Its trying to live together afterwards that causes problems

We must dare and dare again and go on daring

Austere perseverance harsh and continuous may be employed by the least of us and rarely fails of its purpose for its silent power grows irresistibly greater with time

Grant me the courage not to give up even though I think it is hopeless

I try I am trying I was trying I will try I shall in the meantime try I sometimes have tried I shall still by that time be trying

Hard times aint quit and we aint quit

All the sugar was in the bottom of the cup

I have often been adrift but I have always stayed afloat

God helps those who persevere

Gnaw your own bone gnaw at it bury it unearth it gnaw it still

Like ships men flounder time and time again

To strive to seek to find and not to yield

To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it

If you stop struggling then you stop life

One thing we learned To make a start and keep plugging When I had fights at school the little while I went I just bowed my neck and kept swinging until something hit the dirt Sometimes it was me but I always got up

Jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer Men must be in earnest when they kneel at Gods footstool Too often we get fainthearted and quit praying at the point when we ought to begin We let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest Our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will

Be strong It matters not how deep entrenched the wrong How hard the battle goes the day how long Faint notfight on Tomorrow comes the song

Never grow a wishbone daughter where your backbone ought to be

Good people are good because theyve come to wisdom through failure

You may have to fight a battle more than once to win it

Send your noble blood to market and see what it will bring

Noble blood is an accident of fortune noble actions characterize the great

Be noble in every thought And in every deed

This was the noblest Roman of them all

A little nonsense now and then Is relished by the wisest men

The Owl and the PussyCat went to sea In a beautiful peagreen boat

No one is exempt from talking nonsense the misfortune is to do it solemnly

Plain as a nose in a mans face

Give me a man with a good allowance of nose when I want any good headwork done I choose a man provided his education has been suitable with a long nose

If the nose of Cleopatra had been a little shorter the whole face of the world would have been changed

Nothing to do but work Nothing to eat but food Nothing to wear but clothes To keep one from going nude

Blessed be he who expects nothing for he shall never be disappointed

They laboriously do nothing

A life of nothings nothing worth From that first nothing ere his birth To that last nothing under earth

You can have no oath registered in heaven to destroy the Government while I shall have the most solemn one to preserve protect and defend it

Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth But the plain single vow that is vowd true

Ill take thy word for faith not ask thine oath Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both

Obedience alone gives the right to command

Let they childs first lesson be obedience and the second will be what thou wilt

Women are perfectly well aware that the more they seem to obey the more they rule

Let them obey that know not how to rule

The eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it

I give the fight up let there be an end A privacy an obscure nook for me I want to be forgotten even by God

Full many a flower is born to blush unseen And waste its sweetness on the desert air

How happy is the blameless vestals lot The world forgetting by the world forgot

How many a rustic Milton has passed by Stifling the speechless longings of his heart In unremitting drudgery and care How many a vulgar Cato has compelled His energies no longer tameless then To mold a pin or fabricate a nail

Thus let me live unseen unknown Thus unlamented let me die Steal from the world and not a stone Tell where I lie

Tis distance lends enchantment to the view and robes the mountain in its azure hue

All of us are watchers of television of time clocks of traffic on the freeway but few are observers Everyone is looking not many are seeing

As a man is so he sees

My evening visitors if they cannot see the clock should find the time in my face

I keep six honest servingmen they taught me all I know their names are What and Why and When and How and Where and Who

I rather like the world The flesh is pleasing and the Devil does not trouble me

It is the theory that decides what can be observed

Mystery is not profoundness

The difference between landscape and landscape is small but theres a great difference in the beholders

The eyes are the window of the soul

To survive the day is triumph enough for the walking wounded among the great many of us

The eyes believe themselves the ears believe other people

The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend

The things we see are the minds best bet as to what is out front

You can observe a lot just by watching

The eye is the jewel of the body

The ear tends to be lazy craves the familiar and is shocked by the unexpected the eye on the other hand tends to be impatient craves the novel and is bored by repetition

The eyes indicate the antiquity of the soul

To become the spectator of ones own life is to escape the suffering of life

One must always tell what one sees Above all which is more difficult one must always see what one sees

A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees

Cultivated men and women who do not skim the cream of life and are attached to the duties yet escape the harsher blows make acute and balanced observers

People only see what they are prepared to see

The lower classes of men though they do not think it worthwhile to record what they perceive nevertheless perceive everything that is worth noting the difference between them and a man of learning often consists in nothing more than the latters facility for expression

Theres none so blind as those who wont see

Obstinacy and vehemency in opinion are the surest proofs of stupidity

An obstinate man does not hold opinions but they hold him

I hold every man a debtor to his profession from the which as men of course do seek to receive countenance and profit so ought they of duty to endeavor themselves by way of amends to be a help and ornament thereunto

The crowning fortune of a man is to be born to some pursuit which finds him employment and happiness whether it be to make baskets or broadswords or canals or statues or songs

The ugliest of trades have their moments of pleasure Now if I were a gravedigger or even a hangman there are some people I could work for with a great deal of enjoyment

Full many a gem of purest ray serene The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear

The breaking waves dashed high On a stern and rockbound coast And the woods against a stormy sky Their giant branches tossd

Love the sea I dote upon it from the beach

Praise the sea but keep on land

Rocked in the cradle of the deep I lay me down in peace to sleep

The very essence of a free government consists in considering offices as public trusts bestowed for the good of the country and not for the benefit of an individual or a party

If a due participation of office is a matter of right how are vacancies to be obtained Those by death are few by resignation none

This struggle and scramble for office for a way to live without work will finally test the strength of our institutions

The insolence of office

No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow

Youth troubles over eternity age grasps at a day and is satisfied to have even the day

Nothing is worth more than this day

I have come to understand that every day is something to cherish

What a folly to dread the thought of throwing away life at once and yet have no regard to throwing it away by parcels and piecemeal

Not a day passes over this earth but men and women of note do great deeds speak great words and suffer noble sorrows

We create our fate every day we live

Who loses a day loses life

May you live all the days of your life

If we only knew the real value of a day

We are involved in a life that passes understanding our highest business is our daily life

We die daily Happy those who daily come to life as well

He who has lived a day has lived an age

Life we learn too late is in the living in the tissue of every day and hour

To sensible men every day is a day of reckoning

A days impact is better than a month of dead pull

They deem me mad because I will not sell my days for gold and I deem them mad because they think my days have a price

The proper function of man is to live not to exist I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them

A day an hour of virtuous liberty is worth a whole eternity in bondage

Live mindful of how brief your life is

Gladly accept the gifts of the present hour

Everyone once once only Just once and no more And we also once Never again

Most of us spend our lives as if we had another one in the bank

Its better to be a lion for a day than a sheep all your life

While we live let us live

No objects of value are worth risking the priceless experience of waking up one more day

Every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour

Some days you tame the tiger And some days the tiger has you for lunch

So teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom

You have got to own your days and live them each one of them every one of them or else the years go right by and none of them belong to you

The ideal never comes Today is ideal for him who makes it so

True wisdom lies in gathering the precious things out of each day as it goes by

The most important thing in our lives is what we are doing now

Write it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year

He possesses dominion over himself and is happy who can every day say I have lived Tomorrow the heavenly Father may either involve the world in dark clouds or cheer it with clear sunshine he will not however render ineffectual the things which have already taken place

Each day each hour an entire life

The days come and go like muffled and veiled figures sent from a distant friendly party but they say nothing and if we do not use the gifts they bring they carry them as silently away

Your daily life is your temple and your religion

He is only rich who owns the day There is no king rich man fairy or demon who possesses such power as that

Life is now this day this hour and is probably the only experience of the kind one is to have

Gather ye rosebuds while ye may Old time is still aflying And this same flower that smiles today Tomorrow will be dying

Seize the hour

Time like money is measured by our needs

Nothing is ours except time

Nothing in business is so valuable as time

Many people take no care of their money till they come nearly to the end of it and others do just the same with their time

Possessions dwindle I mourn their loss But I mourn the loss of time much more for anyone can save his purse but none can win back lost time

Riches are chiefly good because they give us time

One realizes the full importance of time only when there is little of it left Every mans greatest capital asset is his unexpired years of productive life

Know the true value of time snatch seize and enjoy every moment of it No idleness no laziness no procrastination never put off till tomorrow what you can do today

A sense of the value of time is an essential preliminary to efficient work it is the only method of avoiding hurry

All my possessions for a moment of time

Let me tell thee time is a very precious gift of God so precious that its only given to us moment by moment

Pick my left pocket of its silver dime but spare the rightit holds my golden time

We work not only to produce but to give value to time

Dollars cannot buy yesterday

As every thread of gold is valuable so is every moment of time

Minutes are worth more than money Spend them wisely

Time is the coin of your life It is the only coin you have and only you can determine how it will be spent Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you

Every minute of life carries with it its miraculous value and its face of eter1nal youth

Lost time is never found again

If a person gives you his time he can give you no more precious gift

You may ask me for anything you like except time

The laboring man and the artificer knows what every hour of his time is worth and parts not with it but for the full value

Time isnt a commodity something you pass around like cake Time is the substance of life When anyone asks you to give your time theyre really asking for a chunk of your life

Love and timethose are the only two things in all the world and all of life that cannot be bought but only spent

There is nothing good in this world which time does not improve

Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend

The great rule of moral conduct is next to God to respect Time

It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important

One hour of life crowded to the full with glorious action and filled with noble risks is worth whole years of those mean observances of paltry decorum

Dont be fooled by the calendar There are only as many days in the year as you make use of One man gets only a weeks value out of a year while another man gets a full years value out of a week

Our costliest expenditure is time

The Importance of Using Time Well How pleasant it is at the end of the day No follies to have to repent But reflect on the past and be able to say That my time has been properly spent

I must govern the clock not be governed by it

You are no more exempt from times inexorable passing than Macbeth Whether time is your friend or foe depends on how you use it

Millions long for immortality who do not know what to do with themselves on a rainy Sunday afternoon

The organized person makes the most of his time and goes to his bed for the night perfectly relaxed for rest and renewal

Have regular hours for work and play make each day both useful and pleasant and prove that you understand the worth of time by employing it well Then youth will be delightful old age will bring few regrets and life will become a beautiful success

He who every morning plans the transactions of the day and follows out that plan carries a thread that will guide him through the labyrinth of the most busy life If the disposal of time is surrendered merely to the chance of incident chaos will soon reign

Have a time and place for everything and do everything in its time and place and you will not only accomplish more but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying

It is not how many years we live but rather what we do with them

During a very busy life I have often been asked How did you manage to it all The answer is very simple it is because I did everything promptly

Time cannot be expanded accumulated mortgaged hastened or retarded

Seize time by the forelock

Time is a tyranny to be abolished

The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up the rest

The ability to concentrate and to use time well is everything

Time is an equal opportunity employer Each human being has exactly the same number of hours and minutes every day Rich people cant buy more hours Scientists cant invent new minutes And you cant save time to spend it on another day Even so time is amazingly fair and forgiving No matter how much time youve wasted in the past you still have an entire tomorrow Success depends upon using it wiselyby planning and setting priorities

An Italian philosopher said that time was his estate an estate indeed which will produce nothing without cultivation but will always abundantly repay the labors of industry and generally satisfy the most extensive desires if no part of it be suffered to lie in waste by negligence to be overrun with noxious plants or laid out for show rather than for use

Timely service like timely gifts is doubled in value

Time is the one thing that can never be retrieved

We must use time as a tool not as a crutch

Make use of time let not advantage slip

O for an engine to keep back all clocks

You may delay but time will not

He who would make serious use of his life must always act as though he had a long time to live and schedule his time as though he were about to die

The highest value in life is found in the stewardship of time

A stale mind is the devils breadbox

I wish I could stand on a busy corner hat in hand and beg people to throw me all their wasted hours

Every day I live I am more convinced that the waste of life lies in the love we have not given the powers we have not used the selfish prudence that will risk nothing and which shirking pain misses happiness as well

Wasted time means wasted lives

Regret for time wasted can become a power for good in the time that remains if we will only stop the waste and the idle useless regretting

Economy is the thief of time

I wasted time and now doth time waste me

All that time is lost which might be better employed

Lost yesterday somewhere between sunrise and sunset two golden hours each set with sixty diamond minutes No reward is offered for they are gone forever

Thrift of time will repay you in afterlife with a usury of profit beyond your most sanguine dreams waste of it will make you dwindle alike in intellectual and moral stature beyond your darkest reckoning

The clock upbraids me with the waste of time

Time is lost when we have not lived a full human life time unenriched by experience creative endeavor enjoyment and suffering

Still on it creeps Each little moment at anothers heels Till hours days years and ages are made up Of such small parts as these and men look back Worn and bewilderd wondering how it is

Doest thou love life Then do not squander time for that is the stuff life is made of

Time wasted is a theft from God

Lost time is like a run in a stocking It always gets worse

As if you could kill time without injuring eternity

Killing time is the chief end of our society

You can kill time or kill yourself it comes to the same thing in the end

No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any

Time is that which man is always trying to kill but which ends in killing him

Do not wait for leaders do it alone person to person

Men talk of killing time while time quietly kills them

Modern man thinks he loses somethingtimewhen he does not do things quickly Yet he does not know what to do with the time he gains except kill it

If you want to kill time try working it to death

A man who dares to waste one hour of life has not discovered the value of life

If time be of all things most precious wasting time must be the greatest prodigality since lost time is never found again

Dont agonize Organize

Curse ruthless time Curse our mortality How cruelly short is the allotted span for all we must cram into it

Death and taxes and childbirth Theres never any convenient time for any of them

There is a time for work And a time for love That leaves no other time

You will never find time for anything If you want time you must make it

We have as much time as we need

Ah the clock is always slow it is later than you think

The fortyfourhour week has no charm for me Im looking for a fortyhour day

Those who make the worst use of their time most complain of its brevity

I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think all the walks I want to take all the books I want to read and all the friends I want to see

What we love to do we find time to do

Time stays long enough for anyone who will use it

There is time for everything

It is nonsense to say there is not enough time to be fully informed Time given to thought is the greatest timesaver of all

We all find time to do what we really want to do

Time is a fixed income and as with any income the real problem facing most of us is how to live successfully within our daily allotment

We shall never have more time We have and have always had all the time there is No object is served in waiting until next week or even until tomorrow Keep going Concentrate on something useful

There is time enough for everything in the course of the day if you do but one thing at once but there is not time enough in the year if you will do two things at a time

Much may be done in those little shreds and patches of time which every day produces and which most men throw away

Learn to use ten minutes intelligently It will pay you huge dividends

It is better to do the most trifling thing in the world than to regard half an hour as trifle

I recommend you to take care of the minutes for the hours will take care of themselves

The real secret of how to use time is to pack it as you would a portmanteau filling up the small spaces with small things

One must learn a different sense of time one that depends more on small amounts than big ones

An earnest purpose finds time or makes it It seizes on spare moments and turns fragments to golden account

Guard well your spare moments They are like uncut diamonds Discard them and their value will never be known Improve them and they will become the brightest gems in a useful life

The butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough

That man is happiest who lives from day to day and asks no more garnering the simple goodness of life

It is only possible to live happilyeverafter on a daytoday basis

Happiness is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day

All the great blessings of my life are present in my thoughts today

The best way to secure future happiness is to be as happy as is rightfully possible today

A fool bolts pleasure then complains of indigestion

Happiness is to be found along the way not at the end of the road for then the journey is over and it is too late Today this hour this minute is the day the hour the minute for each of us to sense the fact that life is good with all of its trials and troubles and perhaps more interesting because of them

Each day provides its own gifts

Let us savour the swift delights of the most beautiful of our days

Death accompanies us at every step and enables us to use those moments when life smiles at us to feel more deeply the sweetness of life The more certain the end the more tempting the minute

Happiness is not a state to arrive at but a manner of traveling

My advice to you is not to inquire why or whither but just to enjoy your ice cream while its on your plate

Those who face that which is actually before them unburdened by the past undistracted by the future these are they who live who make the best use of their lives these are those who have found the secret of contentment

And that was victory The freedom to sprawl loosely upon a city street heat his coffee and eat a can of beans with no enemy bullets forcing him to toss the can aside while diving behind another wall for momentary survival

Taking time to live is taking time to appreciate simple silence as better than any kind of talk or watching a flower or watching a guy wash the windows on a skyscraper and wondering what he is thinking

If you observe a really happy man you will find that he is happy in tiie course of living life twentyfour crowded hours each day

To fill the hour that is happiness to fill the hour and leave no crevice for a repentance or an approval

Live your life each day as you would climb a mountain An occasional glance toward the summit keeps the goal in mind but many beautiful scenes are to be observed from each new vantage point Climb slowly steadily enjoying each passing moment and the view from the summit will serve as a fitting climax for the journey

One day of pleasure is worth two of sorrow

Present joys are more to flesh and blood Than the dull prospect of a distant good

In order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past which I often did not fully enjoy because I was comparing them with other moments of the future

Live in daytight compartments

If you are not happy here and now you never will be

People who postpone happiness are like children who try chasing rainbows in an effort to find the pot of gold at the rainbows end Your life will never be fulfilled until you are happy here and now

Hes one of those Christmas Eve guys There are people like that every day in their lives is Christmas Eve

Learn to drink the cup of life as it comes

Every day give yourself a good mental shampoo

There is no other solution to mans progress but the days honest work the days honest decisions the days generous utterances and the days good deed

Leisure for reverie gay or somber does much to enrich life

A man should hear a little music read a little poetry and see a fine picture every day of his life in order that worldly cares may not obliterate the sense of the beautiful which God has implanted in the human soul

You have to set new goals every day

I have resolved that from this day on I will do all the business I can honestly have all the fun I can reasonably do all the good I can willingly and save my digestion by thinking pleasantly

Make the most of today Translate your good intentions into actual deeds

Today is the day in which to express your noblest qualities of mind and heart to do at least one worthy thing which you have long postponed

Do what you can with what you have where you are

Our grand business undoubtedly is not to see what lies dimly at a distance but to do what lies clearly at hand

My formula for living is quite simple I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night In between I occupy myself as best I can

What you are afraid to do is a clear indicator of the next thing you need to do

If we cannot meet our everyday surroundings with equanimity and pleasure and grow each day in some useful direction then life is on the road toward misfortune misery and destruction

A days work is a days work neither more nor less and the man who does it needs a days sustenance a nights repose and due leisure whether he be painter or ploughman

Add each day something to fortify you against poverty and death

It isnt hard to be good from time to time in sports Whats tough is being good every day

Make it a point to do something every day that you dont want to do This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain

Realize life as an end in itself Functioning is all there is

He has not learned the first lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear

A homer a day will boost my pay

Act well at the moment and you have performed a good action to all eternity

If I had my life to live over I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall I would go to more dances I would ride more merrygorounds I would pick more daisies

Nothing determines who we will become so much as those things we choose to ignore

Love and do what you like

Take the time to come home to yourself everyday

The power of a mans virtue should not be measured by his special efforts but by his ordinary doing

The great business of life is to be to do to do without and to depart

Know what you want to do hold the thought firmly and do every day what should be done and every sunset will see you that much nearer the goal

It is no easy thing for a principle to become a mans own unless each day he maintains it and works it out in his life

Follow your bliss Joseph Campbell Resolve to perform what you ought Perform without fail what you resolve

Resolve to edge in a little reading every day if it is but a single sentence If you gain fifteen minutes a day it will make itself felt at the end of the year

I work every dayor at least I force myself into my office or room I may get nothing done but you dont earn bonuses without putting in time Nothing may come for three months but you dont get the fourth without it

Take short views hope for the best and trust in God

Each day can be one of triumph if you keep up your interests

When action grows unprofitable gather information when information grows unprofitable sleep

I long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble

To do the useful thing to say the courageous thing to contemplate the beautiful thing that is enough for one mans life

Showing up is 80 percent of life

Do you know that disease and death must needs overtake us no matter what we are doing What do you wish to be doing when it overtakes you If you have anything better to be doing when you are so overtaken get to work on that

Have patience with all things but chiefly have patience with yourself Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections but instantly set about remedying themevery day begin the task anew

Without duty life is soft and boneless

A man may fulfill the object of his existence by asking a question he cannot answer and attempting a task he cannot achieve

And each man stands with his face in the light of his own drawn sword Ready to do what a hero can

Every day give yourself a good mental shampoo

To look up and not down To look forward and not back To look out and not in and To lend a hand

Do all the good you can By all the means you can In all the ways you can In all the places you can At all the times you can

I like the man who faces what he must With steps triumphant and a heart of cheer Who fights the daily battle without fear

To accomplish our destiny we must cover before nightfall the distance assigned to each of us

Each day should be passed as though it were our last

Learn as if you were going to live forever Live as if you were going to die tomorrow

One should count each day a separate life

If every day I dare to remember that I am here on loan that this house this hillside these minutes are all leased to me not given I will never despair

To live each day as though ones last never flustered never apathetic never attitudinizinghere is perfection of character

Look at everything as though you were seeing it for the first time or the last time Then your time on earth will be filled with glory

The years seem to rush by now and I think of death as a fast approaching end of a journeydouble and treble reason for loving as well as working while it is day

Study as if you were going to live forever live as if you were going to die tomorrow

Every day is a little life live every day as if it would be the last Those that dare lose a day are dangerously prodigal those that dare misspend it are desperate

You have to count on living every single day in a way you believe will make you feel good about your life so that if it were over tomorrow youd be content with yourself

No one can confidently say that he will still be living tomorrow

Happy the man and happy he alone He who can call today his own He who secure within can say Tomorrow do thy worst For I have lived today

Do your best every day and your life will gradually expand into satisfying fullness

There are only three colors ten digits and seven notes its what we do with them thats important

Any mans life will be filled with constant and unexpected encouragement if he makes up his mind to do his level best each day

Do each daily task the best we can act as though the eye of opportunity were always upon us

What a man accomplishes in a day depends upon the way in which he approaches his tasks When we accept tough jobs as a challenge to our ability and wade into them with joy and enthusiasm miracles can happen

Look at a day when you are supremely satisfied at the end Its not a day when you lounge around doing nothing its when youve had everything to do and youve done it

So get a few laughs and do the best you can

I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability And when youve done the best you can you cant do any better So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it

That man is blest who does his best and leaves the rest

When you rise in the morning form a resolution to make the day a happy one for a fellow creature

He who allows his day to pass by without practicing generosity and enjoying lifes pleasures is like a blacksmiths bellows he breathes but does not live

Think that day lost whose descending sun views from thy hand no noble action done

I expect to pass through life but once If therefore there can be any kindness I can show or any good thing I can do to any fellow human being let me do it now

Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity

The most thoroughly wasted of all days is that on which one has not laughed

Each day and the living of it has to be a conscious creation in which discipline and order are relieved with some play and pure foolishness

Sweets are good for the nerves

Fat gives things flavor

Friends I beg you do not shirk your daily task of indolence

If someone said Write a sentence about your life Id write I want to go outside and play

We should consider every day lost on which we have not danced at least once

Life is about enjoying yourself and having a good time

Put a little fun into your life Try dancing

He who does not get fun and enjoyment out of every day needs to reorganize his life

Unless each day can be looked back upon by an individual as one in which he has had some fun some joy some real satisfaction that day is a loss

Take time every day to do something silly

Its fun to get together and have something good to eat at least once a day Thats what human life is all aboutenjoying things

Come let us give a little time to folly and even in a melancholy day let us find time for an hour of pleasure

No matter what looms ahead if you can eat today enjoy the sunlight today mix good cheer with friends today enjoy it and bless God for it

Be Satisfied with a Good Days Work There are hundreds of tasks we feel we must accomplish in the day but if we do not take them one at a time we are bound to break our own physical or mental structure

A man can do only what he can do But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day

If I had my life to live over I would start barefoot earlier in the spring and stay that way later in the fall I would go to more dances I would ride more merrygorounds I would pick more daisies

I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it

We cannot do everything at once but we can do something at once

Always do one thing less than you think you can do

I come to the office each morning and stay for long hours doing what has to be done to the best of my ability And when youve done the best you can you cant do any better So when I go to sleep I turn everything over to the Lord and forget it

A days work is a days work neither more nor less and the man who does it needs a days sustenance a nights repose and due leisure whether he be painter or ploughman

Sufficient to each day are the duties to be done and the trials to be endured

I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith

I look back on my life like a good days work it is done and I am satisfied with it

The moment we pass out of our habits we lose all sense of permanency and routine

Manners are a sensitive awareness of the feelings of others If you have that awareness you have good manners no matter what fork you use

And hearts have been broken from harsh words spoken That sorrow can neer set right

That which is horrifying to you dont do to anybody else

It is too bad if you have to do everything upon reflection and cant do anything from early habit

Most of life is routinedull and grubby but routine is the mountain that keeps a man going If you wait for inspiration youll be standing on the corner after the parade is a mile down the street

Good habits which bring our lower passions and appetites under automatic control leave our natures free to explore the larger experiences of life

Without the aid of prejudice and custom I should not be able to find my way across the room

Motivation is what gets you started Habit is what keeps you going

Habits are safer than rules you dont have to watch them And you dont have to keep them either they keep you

Habit is not mere subjugation it is a tender tie when one remembers habit it seems to have been happiness

To learn new habits is everything for it is to reach the substance of life Life is but a tissue of habits

Choose always the way that seems the best however rough it may be custom will soon render it easy and agreeable

Quality is not an act It is a habit

It is not in novelty but in habit that we find the greatest pleasure

Habit is stronger than reason

Character is simply habit long enough continued

Nothing is more powerful than habit

If you do the same thing every day at the same time for the same length of time youll save yourself from many a sink Routine is a condition of survival

Have a time and place for everything and do everything in its time and place and you will not only accomplish more but have far more leisure than those who are always hurrying

Anyone can carry his burden however hard until nightfall Anyone can do his work however hard for one day Anyone can live sweetly patiently lovingly purely till the sun goes down And this is all life really means

Come what may time and the hour runs through the roughest day

At any rate you can bear it for a quarter of an hour

The longest day is soon ended

The secret of my success is that I always managed to live to fly another day

The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic the passions that we feel expand it those that we inspire contract it and habit fills up what remains

A day is a miniature eternity

One day with life and heart is more than time enough to find a world

A day is a span of time no one is wealthy enough to waste

When a man sits with a pretty girl for an hour it seems like a minute But let him sit on a hot stove for a minute and its longer than any hour Thats relativity

Too slow for those who wait Too swift for those who fear Too long for those who grieve Too short for those who rejoice But for those who love time is not

The less one has to do the less time one finds to do it in One yawns one procrastinates one can do it when one will and therefore one seldom does it at all whereas those who have a great deal of business must buckle to it and then they always find time enough to do it

Time is nothing absolute its duration depends on the rate of thought and feeling

Time is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people

What then is time If no one asks me I know what it is If I wish to explain it to him who asks I do not know

Time is the product of changing realities beings existences

Time is the arbitrary division of eternity

Time is a part of eternity and of the same piece with it

Each day is a little life every waking and rising a little birth every fresh morning a little youth every going to rest and sleep a little death

Time is eternity begun

Time is not a line but a series of nowpoints

You cant measure time in days the way you can money in dollars because each day is different

An hour of pain is as long as a day of pleasure

The value of life lies not in the length of days but in the use we make of them a man may live long yet live very little

Reality is a staircase going neither up nor down we dont move today is today always is today

What runs through a person like water through a sieve

Scrolls write on them what you want to be remembered for

Every day is a messenger of God

A little space of time before time expires a little way of breath

Time is an avid gambler who has no need to cheat to win every time

Time is the only critic without ambition

Time is the most valuable thing a man can spend

Time is a storm in which we are all lost

Time is the wisest counsellor of all

Time is the moving image of eternity

Time is the soul of this world

Time is a sandpile we run our fingers in

Time is one kind of robber whom the law does not strike at and who steals what is most precious to men

Time is the tyrant of the body

Time is that in which all things pass away

Time is a file that wears and makes no noise

Time is what we want most but what we use worst

Time is the king of men

Time is the life of the soul

Time is the dressing room for eternity

Time is an available instrument for reaching the eternal

Time itself is an element

Time is the devourer of all things

Time is the subtle thief of youth

Time is the rider that breaks youth

Time is an eternal guest that banquets on our ideals and bodies

Time is an illusionto orators

The surest poison is time

Time is a great manager it arranges things well

Time is a river without banks

Time is the greatest and longestestablished spinner of all His factory is a secret place his work noiseless and his hands are mutes

Time is the stuff lifes made of

Time is my estate to Time Im heir

Time is change transformation evolution

Time is a circus always packing up and moving away

Time is a dressmaker specializing in alterations

Time is the greatest innovator

Time is a wealth of change but the clock in its parody makes it mere change and no wealth

Time is but the stream I go afishing in

Time is the silent neverresting thing rolling rushing on swift silent like an allembracing oceantide on which we and all the universe swim

Time is a flowing river Happy those who allow themselves to be carried unresisting with the current They float through easy days They live unquestioning in the moment

Time is a very shadow that passeth away

Time is the author of authors

Time is a stream which glides smoothly on and is past before we know

Time is a sort of river of passing events and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place and this too will be swept away

Time is the sea in which men grow are born or die

Time is the longest distance between two places

Id like to introduce a man with a lot of charm talent and wit Unfortunately he couldnt be here tonight so instead

I do not stand on protocol If you just call me Excellency it will be okay

The numberone fear in life is public speaking and the numbertwo fear is death This means that if you go to a funeral youre better off in the casket than giving the eulogy

At the end of a long introduction You omitted perhaps one thing that in 1974 I had a hemorrhoidectomy

My father gave me these hints on speech making Be sincere be brief be seated

A good speech like a womans skirt should be long enough to cover the subject and short enough to create interest I have been asked to give my address in the remaining five minutes That I can do Here it is 10 Carlton Gardens London England

I sort of feel like Cindy Crawfords new husband on their wedding night I know whats expected of me Im just not sure Ive got the ability to make it interesting

If any of you are related to our main guest let me know so I can speak slowly

As my mother used to say Mimic a duck act calm and unruffled on the surface but paddle like crazy underneath

Some people might say that I think too highly of you just because I worship the water you walk on

As Spinoza or someone very much like him once said

An evening like this would be empty without some reference to politics so lets just think of this as empty

Speeches are like steer horns a point here a point there and a lot of bull in between

My job is to talk to you and your job is to listen If you finish first please let me know

I have noticed that the people who are late are often so much jollier than the people who have to wait for them

I dont want to be patronizing that means talking down

speaker I have only ten minutes and hardly know where to begin voice in back Begin at the ninth

After such an introduction I can hardly wait to hear what Im going to say

I was chosen to speak due to my warm personality Look up warm and it means not so hot

A speech thats full of sparkling wit will keep its hearer grinning provided its end is close to its beginning

It usually takes me more than three weeks to prepare a good impromptu speech

Id like to tell you some jokes now but youd only laugh

The recipe for a good speech includes some shortening

I was told to be accurate be brief and then be seated So I promise I shall be brief as possible no matter how long it takes me

Thank you for the privilege of speaking to you in this magnificent auditorium You know the meaning of the word auditorium dont you It is derived from two Latin words audio to hear and taurus the bull

I was chosen to speak today based on my senility

A toastmaster is a man who eats a meal he doesnt want so he can get up and tell a lot of stories he doesnt remember to people whove already heard them

As one skeleton said to the other if I had any guts Id get the heck out of here

Thanks for the nice introduction Next to my resume thats the closest Ill ever come to perfection

We were worried that our main speaker wouldnt be able to make it tonight But fortunately due to a hole in the prosecutions case

I thought Id begin by reading a poem by Shakespeare but then I thought Why should I He never reads any of mine

I hope you will excuse my being late The person in this organization who gave me directions here has obviously heard me speak before

When I was preparing for this speech I asked my family for advice One member replied Theres a first time for everything so try to be funny and brief

Most experts suggest that one should open with a joke Obviously theyve never heard me tell a joke

Good evening ladies and gentlemen Im pleased to be with you Pause That concludes my prepared remarks

Im moving down here because some of you in the back might not be able to hear my talk and that wouldnt be fair to those who can hear it

It has been discovered experimentally that you can draw laughter from an audience anywhere in the world of any class or race simply by walking on a stage and uttering the words I am a married man

This gathering is what I call intimate which really means Where is everybody

Do not choose to be wrong for the sake of being different

If you want people to think well of you do not speak well of yourself

New opinions are always suspected and usually opposed without any other reason but because they are not already common

So many men so many opinions

Three Spaniards four opinions

We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we dont care for

One should respect public opinion in so far as it is necessary to avoid starvation and to keep out of prison but anything that goes beyond this is voluntary submission to an unnecessary tyranny

Public opinion a vulgar impertinent anonymous tyrant who deliberately makes life unpleasant for anyone who is not content to be the average man

Youve no idea what a poor opinion I have of myself and how little I deserve it

Predominant opinions are generally the opinions of the generation that is vanishing

To be positive to be mistaken at the top of ones voice

When I want your opinion Ill give it to you

The sound of tireless voices is the price we pay for the right to hear the music of our own opinions

It is always considered a piece of impertinence in England if a man of less than two or three thousand a year has any opinions at all upon important subjects

The pressure of public opinion is like the pressure of the atmosphere you cant see it but all the same it is sixteen pounds to the square inch

The right to be heard does not automatically include the right to be taken seriously

The world is not run by thought nor by imagination but by opinion

No and Yes are words quickly said but they need a great amount of thought before you utter them

I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it

It is not truth but opinion that can travel the world without a passport

There never were two opinions alike in all the world no more than two hours or two grains the most universal quality is diversity

A difference of opinion is what makes horse racing and missionaries

Public opinion is a compound of folly weakness prejudice wrong feeling right feeling obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs

The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinions

All empty souls tend to extreme opinion

Too often we enjoy the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought

Opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them

There are a great many opinions in this world and a good half of them are professed by people who have never been in trouble

It were not best that we should all think alike it is difference of opinion that makes horseraces

Stiff in opinion always in the wrong

It is rare that the public sentiment decides immorally or unwisely and the individual who differs from it ought to distrust and examine well his own opinion

Those who never retract their opinions love themselves more than they love truth

Public opinion though often formed upon a wrong basis yet generally has a strong underlying sense of justice

Opinions cannot survive if one has no chance to fight for them

The foolish and the dead alone never change their opinion

Force and not opinion is the queen of the world but it it opinion that uses the force

Public opinion is a compound of folly weakness prejudice wrong feeling right feeling obstinacy and newspaper paragraphs

The feeble tremble before opinion the foolish defy it the wise judge it the skillful direct it

I know where there is more wisdom than is found in Napoleon Voltaire or all the ministers present and to come in public opinion

You create your opportunities by asking for them

A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds

Look for opportunity You cant wait for it to knock on the door You might not be home

If you want to succeed in the world you must make your own opportunities

Life is a narrative that you have a hand in writing

Mediocre men wait for opportunity to come to them Strong able alert men go after opportunity

A filly who wants to run will always find a rider

Life is what we make it always has been always will be

God forgives those who invent what they need

Many things are lost for want of asking

You dont just luck into things you build step by step whether its friendships or opportunities

Every man is the architect of his own fortune

He that waits upon fortune is never sure of a dinner

There is no security on this earth Only opportunity

Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity they seem more afraid of life than of death

Freedom is nothing else but a chance to be better whereas enslavement is a certainty of the worst

The opportunity is often lost by deliberating

I have always been waiting for something bettersometimes to see the best I had snatched from me

The sad truth is that opportunity doesnt knock twice You can put things off until tomorrow but tomorrow may never come Where will you be a few years down the line Will it be everything you dreamed of We seal our fate with the choices we take but dont give a second thought to the chances we take

You decide youll wait for your pitch Then as the ball starts toward the plate you think about your stance And then you think about your swing And then you realize that the ball that went past you for a strike was your pitch

Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises

Any ritual is an opportunity for transformation

Ability is of little account without opportunity

Our opportunities to do good are our talents

Opportunity knocks at every mans door once On some mens door it hammers till it breaks down the door and then it goes in and wakes him up if hes asleep and ever afterward it works for him as a night watchman

It is less important to redistribute wealth than it is to redistribute opportunity

You cant make souffle rise twice

A door that seems to stand open must be a mans size or it is not the door that Providence means for him

Next to knowing when to seize an opportunity the most important thing in life is to know when to forgo an advantage

The follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didnt commit when he had the opportunity

To see a shadow and think it is a treethat is a pity but to see a tree and to think it a shadow can be fatal

Great opportunities come to all but many do not know they have met them The only preparation to take advantage of them is simple fidelity to watch what each day brings

Opportunities are everywhere

Opportunities are usually disguised as hard work so most people dont recognize them

The world is all gates all opportunities strings of tension waiting to be struck

No great man ever complains of want of opportunity

Great opportunities to help others seldom come but small ones come daily

Men do with opportunities as children do at the seashore they fill their little hands with sand and then let the grains fall through one by one till all are gone

Do not wait for ideal circumstances nor for the best opportunities they will never come

Nothing is so often irretrievably missed as a daily opportunity

If a man looks sharply and attentively he shall see fortune for though she be blind yet she is not invisible

Know thine opportunity

In great affairs we ought to apply ourselves less to creating chances than to profiting from those that are offered

Opportunity is as scarce as oxygen men fairly breathe it and do not know it

Opportunities do not come with their values stamped upon them To face every opportunity of life thoughtfully and ask its meaning bravely and earnestly is the only way to meet supreme opportunities when they come whether openfaced or disguised

We are told that talent creates its own opportunities But it sometimes seems that intense desire creates not only its own opportunities but its own talents

How many opportunities present themselves to a man without his noticing them

Luck affects everything Let your hook be always cast In the stream where you least expect it there will be a fish

The opportunity that God sends does not wake up him who is asleep

Present opportunities are neglected and attainable good is slighted by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages

Opportunities multiply as they are seized they die when neglected Life is a long line of opportunities

It is often hard to distinguish between the hard knocks in life and those of opportunity

I think luck is the sense to recognize an opportunity and the ability to take advantage of it Everyone has bad breaks but everyone also has opportunities The man who can smile at his breaks and grab his chances gets on

To improve the golden moment of opportunity and catch the good that is within our reach is the great art of life

The greatest achievement of the human spirit is to live up to ones opportunities and make the most of ones resources

When one door closes another opens But we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us

The opportunities for enjoyment in your life are limitless If you feel you are not experiencing enough joy you have only yourself to blame

Opportunities are often things you havent noticed the first time around

The successful man is one who had the chance and took it

Vigilance in watching opportunity tact and daring in seizing upon opportunity force and persistence in crowding opportunity to its utmost possible achievementthese are the martial virtues which must command success

To avoid an occasion for our virtues is a worse degree of failure than to push forward pluckily and make a fall

Opportunity knocks but once

I was seldom able to see an opportunity until it had ceased to be one

If Fortune calls offer him a seat

What the student calls a tragedy the master calls a butterfly

Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work

Times of stress and difficulty are seasons of opportunity when the seeds of progress are sown

We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity

The best impromptu speeches are the ones written well in advance

Opportunity can benefit no man who has not fitted himself to seize it and use it Opportunity woos the worthy shuns the unworthy Prepare yourself to grasp opportunity and opportunity is likely to come your way It is not so fickle capricious and unreasoning as some complain

Opportunity rarely knocks until you are ready And few people have ever been really ready without receiving opportunitys call

The secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes

I always keep myself in a position of being a student

I think the young actor who really wants to act will find a way to keep at it and seize every opportunity that comes along

If you want greater prosperity in your life start forming a vacuum to receive it

Unless a man has trained himself for his chance the chance will only make him ridiculous

Do not suppose opportunity will knock twice at your door

Make hay while the sun shines

Plough deep while sluggards sleep

There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune

The opportunity for doing mischief is found a hundred times a day and of doing good once in a year

In the midst of winter I finally learned that there was in me an invincible summer

One cloud is enough to eclipse all the sun

The progress of rivers to the ocean is not so rapid as that of man to error

When I look in the glass I see that every line in my face means pessimism but in spite of my face that is my experience I remain an optimist

An optimist is a guy that has never had much experience

An optimist is a fellow who believes whats going to be will be postponed

Pessimist one who when he has the choice of two evils chooses both

My pessimism goes to the point of suspecting the sincerity of the pessimists

A pessimist is one who has been compelled to live with an optimist

Pessimism is only the name that men of weak nerves give to wisdom

When it is dark enough you can see the stars

There is not enough darkness in all the world to put out the light of even one small candle

When things come to the worst they generally mend

The optimist claims we live in the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist fears this is true

Still round the corner there may wait a new road or a secret gate

When Fortune empties her chamberpot on your head smile and say We are going to have a summer shower

The world gets better every day then worse again in the evening

A man he seems of cheerful yesterdays And confident tomorrows

There is a budding morrow in midnight

Optimism A cheerful frame of mind that enables a tea kettle to sing though in hot water up to its nose

An optimist sees an opportunity in every calamity a pessimist sees a calamity in every opportunity

To look up and not down To look forward and not back To look out and not in and To lend a hand

Two men look out through the same bars One sees the mud and one the stars

Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow

Oratory is the power to talk people out of their sober and natural opinions

Glittering generalities They are blazing ubiquities

I am not fond of uttering platitudes In stainedglass attitudes

The object of oratory is not truth but persuasion

What the orators want in depth they give you in length

It is much safer to obey than to rule

Let all things be done decently and in order

There is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody anywhere anytime

When liberty destroys order the hunger for order will destroy liberty

Those who are fond of setting things to rights have no great objection to setting them wrong

To have his path made clear for him is the aspiration of every human being in our beclouded and tempestuous existence

Our laws make law impossible our liberties destroy all freedom our property is organized robbery our morality an impudent hypocrisy our wisdom is administered by inexperienced or malexperienced dupes our power wielded by cowards and weaklings and our honour false in all its points I am an enemy of the existing order for good reasons

Crude classifications and false generalizations are the curse of organized life

Timing degree and conviction are the three wise men in this life

We put things in order God does the rest Lay an iron bar east and west it is not magnetized Lay it north and south and it is

I must create a system or be enslaved by another mans

Out of intense complexities intense simplicities emerge

There is no course of life so weak and sottish as that which is managed by order method and discipline

Large organization is loose organization Nay it would be almost as true to say that organization is always disorganization

Thats what learning is You suddenly understand something you understood all your life but in a new way

Have a place for everything and have everything in its place

Set thine house in order

Order is Heavens first law

Originality is the art of concealing your sources

Utter originality is of course out of the question

We do not inherit this land from our ancestors we borrow it from our children

Why cant somebody give us a list of things that everybody thinks and nobody says and another list of things that everybody says and nobody thinks

Originality is nothing but judicious imitation The most original writers borrowed one from another The instruction we find in books is like fire We fetch it from our neighbours kindle it at home communicate it to others and it becomes the property of all

Originality does not consist in saying what no one has ever said before but in saying exactly what you think yourself

What a good thing Adam had when he said a good thing he knew nobody had said it before

All cases are unique and very similar to others

I invent nothing I rediscover

There is nothing new under the sun

When people are free to do as they please they usually imitate each other Originality is deliberate and forced and partakes of the nature of a protest

All profoundly original work looks ugly at first

Riding hard for glory

What is originality Undetected plagiarism

The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion As our case is new so we must think anew and act anew We must disenthrall ourselves

You always admire what you really dont understand

What you cant get is just what suits you

The dream is real my friends The failure to realize it is the only reality

The true exercise of freedom iscannily and wisely and with graceto move inside what space confinesand not seek to know what lies beyond and cannot be touched or tasted

Death and taxes and childbirth Theres never any convenient time for any of them

No one is content with his own lot

Let us accept truth even when it surprises us and alters our views

To have ideals is not the same as to have impracticable ideals

There has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present

Every stage of life has its troubles and no man is content with his own age

We love in others what we lack ourselves and would be everything but what we are

There is less in this than meets the eye

When you dont have any money the problem is food When you have money its sex When you have both its health If everything is simply jake then youre frightened of death

Diogenes was asked what wine he liked best and he answered Somebody elses

The apples on the other side of the wall are the sweetest

Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand

Happiness is usually attributed by adults to children and by children to adults

Acorns were good till bread was found

None of us is ever satisfied with what we are

We always long for forbidden things k and desire what is denied us

Mans heart is never satisfied the snake would swallow the elephant

We all envy other peoples luck

When every blessed thing you have is made of silver or of gold you long for simple pewter

Id rather have written Cheers than anything Ive written

When a mans busy leisure strikes him as a wonderful pleasure and at leisure once is he Straightway he wants to be busy

To most of us the real life is the life we do not lead

Happiness to a dog is what lies on the other side of the door

Man would be otherwise That is the essence of the specifically human

He who would be happy should stay at home

He who leaves his house in search of happiness pursues a shadow

It is not irritating to be where one is It is only irritating to think one would like to be somewhere else

Pioneers may be picturesque figures but they are often rather lonely ones

He that is discontented in one place will seldom be happy in another

We are under the spell always of what is distant from us It is not in our nature to desire passionately what is near at hand

In all climates under all skies mans happiness is always somewhere else

In Rome you long for the country In the country you praise to the skies the distant town

He who would be happy should stay at home

Life is a hospital in which every patient is possessed by the desire of changing his bed One would prefer to suffer near the fire and another is certain he would get well if he were by the window

It is common to overlook what is near by keeping the eye fixed on something remote

There are three wants which can never be satisfied that of the rich who want something more that of the sick who want something different and that of the traveler who says Anywhere but here

Happiness grows at our firesides and is not to be picked in strangers gardens

Men run away to other countries because they are not good in their own and run back to their own because they pass for nothing in the new places

The proper means of increasing the love we bear our native country is to reside some time in a foreign one

If solid happiness we prize within our breast this jewel lies And they are fools who roam the world has nothing to bestow From our own selves our bliss must flow And that dear hutour home

A child on a farm sees a plane fly overhead and dreams of a faraway place A traveler on the plane sees the farmhouse and dreams of home

Life has no smooth road for any of us and in the bracing atmosphere of a high aim the very roughness stimulates the climber to steadier steps till the legend over steep ways to the stars fulfills itself

The only normal people are the ones you dont know very well

Before we set our hearts too much upon anything let us examine how happy they are who already possess it

What makes us discontented with our condition is the absurdly exaggerated idea we have of the happiness of others

Nobodys problem is ideal Nobody has things just as he would like them

Everybody in the world ought to be sorry for everybody else We all have our little private hell

We are convinced that happiness is never to be found and each believes it possessed by others to keep alive the hope of obtaining it for himself

Men would be angels angels would be gods

None think the great unhappy but the great

If every mans internal care Were written on his brow How many would our pity share Who raise our envy now

Misfortunes come to all men

You have no idea how big the other fellows troubles are

I have been very happy very rich very beautiful much adulated very famous and very unhappy

I feel successful when the writing goes well This lasts five minutes Once when I was on the bestseller list I also felt successful That lasted three minutes

Great and small suffer the same mishaps

I thought I had reached a point in life where everything would be smooth But it is not It just gets more jagged and pitted and filled with turns that take you into the dark recesses of your mind It never seems to get easy

If I were given a change of life Id like to see how it would be to live as a mere sixfooter

I just want to be an ordinary girl

Money is another pressure Im not complaining Im just saying that theres a certain luxury in having no money I spent ten years in New York not having it not worrying about it Suddenly you have it then you worry where is it going Am I doing the right thing with it

On the outside one is a star But in reality one is completely alone doubting everything To experience this loneliness of soul is the hardest thing in the world

There is no man in this world without some manner of tribulation or anguish though he be king or pope

The only incurable troubles of the rich are the troubles that money cant cure

There is no man in any rank who is always at liberty to act as he would incline in some quarter or other he is limited by circumstances

None of us can be free of conflict and woe Even the greatest men have had to accept disappointments as their daily bread The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them

Renown is a source of toil and sorrow obscurity is a source of happiness

My crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy

If I had my life to live over I wish I could be a great pianist or something

There is no armour against fate death lays his icy hands on kings

Pale death with impartial tread beats at the poor mans cottage door and at the palaces of kings

I want to be able to live without a crowded calendar I want to be able to read a book without feeling guilty or go to a concert when I like

Id like to be a truck driver I think you could run your life that way It wouldnt be such a bad way of doing it It would offer a chance to be alone

There is as much confusion in the world of the gods as in ours

Pray the gods do not envy your happiness

The suffering of the rich is among the sweetest pleasures of the poor

Oh God dont envy me I have my own pains

Success is counted sweetest by those who never succeed

I have known no man of genius who had not to pay in some affliction or defect either physical or spiritual for what the gods had given him

I have been very happy very rich very beautiful much adulated very famous and very unhappy

I feel successful when the writing goes well This lasts five minutes Once when I was on the bestseller list I also felt successful That lasted three minutes

Men are all the same They always think that something they are going to get is better than what they have got

Not all speed is movement

Success is not greedy as people think but insignificant Thats why it satisfies nobody

Oh I wish that God had not given me what I prayed for It was not so good as I thought

Beggars do not envy millionaires though of course they will envy other beggars who are more successful

Ambition having reached the summit longs to descend

What we call progress is the exchange of one nuisance for another nuisance

The superpowers often behave like two heavily armed blind men feeling their way around a room each believing himself in mortal peril from the other who he assumes to have perfect vision

Wanting to change to improve a persons situation means offering him for difficulties in which he is practiced and experienced other difficulties that will find him perhaps even more bewildered

Being considered beautiful at a young age sends confusing signals You think people only like you because of your beauty

Youth is not a question of years one is young or old from birth

When I was fourteen I was the oldest I ever was Ive been getting younger ever since

A childs world is fresh and new and beautiful full of wonder and excitement It is our misfortune that for most of us that cleareyed vision that true instinct for what is beautiful and aweinspiring is dimmed and even lost before we reach adulthood

Sure Im for helping the elderly Im going to be old myself someday

Youth is something very new twenty years ago no one mentioned it

A comfortable old age is the reward of a wellspent youth Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world

We turn not older with years but newer every day

Old age is when the liver spots show through your gloves

The middle years caught between children and parents free of neither the past stretches back too densely it is too thickly populated the future has not yet thinned out

It is not how old you are but how you are old

One of the many things nobody ever tells you about middle age is that its such a nice change from being young

When you become 100 life changes completely

This is a youthoriented society and the joke is on them because youth is a disease from which we all recover

Old age believe me is a good and pleasant thing It is true you are gently shouldered off the stage but then you are given such a comfortable front stall as spectator

I look forward to growing old and wise and audacious

It is so comical to hear oneself called old even at ninety I suppose

I enjoy my wrinkles and regard them as badges of distinctionIve worked hard for them

Timeour youthit never really goes does it It is all held in our minds

Even I dont wake up looking like Cindy Crawford

We all lose our looks eventually better develop your character and interest in life

The lovely thing about being forty is that you can appreciate twentyfiveyearold men more

The only thing that makes one place more attractive to me than another is the quantity of heart I find in it

A woman may develop wrinkles and cellulite lose her waistline her bustline her ability to bear a child even her sense of humor but none of that implies a loss of her sexuality her femininity

Old age is like a plane flying through a storm Once you are aboard there is nothing you can do

In youth the days are short and the years are long In old age the years are short and days long

How long can you be cute

Being pretty on the inside means you dont hit your brother and you eat all your peasthats what my grandma taught me

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder

When youre fifty you start thinking about things you havent thought about before I used to think getting old was about vanitybut actually its about losing people you love Getting wrinkles is trivial

I am desperate and vulnerable I am always terrified Beauty can sometimes be so very troublesome

I hate myself on the screen I want to die my voice is either too high or too gravelly I want to dive under the carpet Id love to be tall and willowy Im short

After a certain number of years our faces become our biographies

I dont like my voice I dont like the way I look I dont like the way I move I dont like the way I act I mean period So you know I dont like myself

Not always the fanciest cake thats there Is the best to eat

No Doctor I dont want to grow young again I just want to keep on growing old

It is quite wrong to think of old age as a downward slope On the contrary one climbs higher and higher with the advancing years and that too with surprising strides

I look forward to being older when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the i point

When youve got the personality you dont need the nudity

The only real elegance is in the mind if youve got that the rest really comes from it

Beauty can get a woman what she wants love and money But when beauty leaves you so can the things it brought

If youre considered a beauty its hard to be accepted doing anything but standing around

Just because youre beautiful they think you cant act Ive got a lot more to prove

I intimidate men People look a lot but theres no line outside my door

People see you as an object not as a person and they project a set of expectations onto you People who dont have it think beauty is a blessing but actually it sets you apart

I can count the number of dates Ive had on one hand I wish that guys would approach me but they dont

When you step on the first tee it doesnt matter what you look like It doesnt help your 5iron if youre pretty

For years I stopped reading beauty magazines because I couldnt look at one without wanting to blow my brains out How can those women look so good

Each time I get off a plane in Hollywood I dont think Im pretty enough

Frankly I like the fact that I no longer fit the young beauty typepeople take me more seriously now

You know how many stunning women told me they cant stand a goodlooking man Women feel secure with an ugly guy because a man in bad shape isnt gonna cheat

Outstanding beauty like outstanding gifts of any kind tends to get in the way of normal emotional development and thus of that particular success in life which we call happiness

A full bosom is actually a millstone around a womans neck Breasts are not parts of a person but lures slung around her neck to be kneaded and twisted like magic putty or mumbled and mouthed like lolly ices

Plain women know more about men than beautiful ones do

People are crying up the rich and variegated plumage of the peacock and he is himself blushing at the sight of his ugly feet

Im walking insecurity Without all this makeup I look like a refugee when I get up in the morning I generally look like one major bowwow I mean arf

You start out happy that you have no hips or boobs All of a sudden you get them and it feels sloppy Then just when you start liking them they start dropping

The problem with beauty is that its like being born rich and getting poorer

Guys think that if a girl is pretty shes automatically going to say no Most of the guys Ive gone out with Ive had to make it completely obvious that Id like them to ask me out Or Ive had to ask them

I think if I werent so beautiful maybe Id have more character

Not many people ask me out

The striking point about our model family is not simply the competecompete consumeconsume style of life it urges us to follow The striking point in the face of all the propaganda is how few Americans actually live this way

Instead of comparing our lot with that of those who are more fortunate than we are we should compare it with the lot of the great majority of our fellow men It then appears that we are among the privileged

I murmured because I had no shoes until I met man who had no feet

Comparison more than reality makes men happy or wretched

The man with a toothache thinks everyone happy whose teeth are sound The povertystricken man makes the same mistake about the rich man

If you compare yourself with others you may become vain or bitter for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself

I look at what I have not and think myself unhappy others look at what I have and think me happy

Enjoy your own life without comparing it with that of another

If we only wanted to be happy it would be easy but we want to be happier than other people which is almost always difficult since we think them happier than they are

I never admired anothers fortune so much that I became dissatisfied with my own

Every horse thinks his own pack heaviest

Comparisons of ones lot with others teaches us nothing and enfeebles the will

To think well of every other mans condition and to dislike our own is one of the misfortunes of human nature

Other peoples eggs have two yolks

No story ever looks as bad as the story youve just bought no story ever looks as good as the story the other fellow just bought

If all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence every one must take an equal portion most people would be content to take their own and depart

Money it turned out was exactly like sex you thought of nothing else if you didnt have it and thought of other things if you did

Envy is an insult to oneself

Jealousy is no more than feeling alone against smiling enemies

Envy has the ugliness of a trapped rat that has gnawed its own foot in its effort to escape

Jealousy is never satisfied with anything short of omniscience that would detect the subtlest fold in the heart

Envy eats nothing but its own heart

Jealousy is all the fun you think they had

Jealousy would be far less torturous if we understood that love is a passion entirely unrelated to our merits

In jealousy there is more of selflove than love

Jealousy is an inner consciousness of ones own inferiority It is a mental cancer

Jealousy that dragon which slays love under the pretense of keeping it alive

There is no greater glory than love nor any greater punishment than jealousy

As a moth gnaws a garment so doth envy consume a man

Envy is the most stupid of vices for there is no single advantage to be gained from it

The jealous are troublesome to others but torment to themselves

Envy and fear are the only passions to which no pleasure is attached

If malice or envy were tangible and had a shape it would be the shape of a boomerang

Envy is a kind of praise

Envy among other ingredients has a mixture of the love of justice in it We are more angry at undeserved than at deserved good fortune

Envy comes from peoples ignorance of or lack of belief in their own gifts

To cure jealousy is to see it for what it is a dissatisfaction with self

If envy were a fever all the world would be ill

Jealousy is not a barometer by which the depth of love can be read It merely records the degree of the lovers insecurity

The heaven of the envied is hell for the envious

You cant be envious and happy at the same time

The whole art of life is knowing the right time to say things

It is not until you become a mother that your judgment slowly turns to compassion and understanding

If we would build on a sure foundation in friendship we must love friends for their sake rather than for our own

Friendship which is of its nature a delicate thing fastidious slow of growth is easily checked will hesitate demur recoil where love good old blustering love bowls ahead and blunders through every obstacle

It is all right to say exactly what you think if you have learned to think exactly

Silence sweeter is than speech

When we get to wishing a great deal for ourselves whatever we get soon turns into mere limitation and exclusion

The opposite of talking isnt listening The opposite of talking is waiting

Listening is not merely not talking though even that is beyond most of our powers it means taking a vigorous human interest in what is being told us

Why is it that people who cannot show feeling presume that that is a strength and not a weakness

True love grows by sacrifice and the more thoroughly the soul rejects natural satisfaction the stronger and more detached its tenderness becomes

The nice thing about teamwork is that you always have others on your side

If you wish to fear nothing consider that everything is to be feared

I am deliberate and afraid of nothing

I survived my childhood by birthing many separate identities to stand in for one another in times of great stress and fear

How does one kill fear How do you shoot a specter through the heart slash off its spectral head take it by its spectral throat

The brave man is not he who feels no fear For that were stupid and irrational But he whose noble soul its fear subdues And barely dares the danger nature shrinks from

There is very little difference in people but that little difference makes a big difference The little difference is attitude The big difference is whether it is positive or negative

It is not the situation It is your reaction to the situation

There are two big forces at work external and internal We have very little control over external forces such as tornadoes earthquakes floods disasters illness and pain What really matters is the internal force How do I respond to those disasters Over that I have complete control

If you will call your troubles experiences and remember that every experience develops some latent force within you you will grow vigorous and happy however adverse your circumstances may seem to be

Man is so made that whenever anything fires his soul impossibilities vanish

Deep within man dwell those slumbering powers powers that would astonish him that he never dreamed of possessing forces that would revolutionize his life if aroused and put into action

Trust yourself You know more than you think you do

If we did all the things we are capable of doing we would literally astound ourselves

Each of us makes his own weather determines the color of the skies in the emotional universe which he inhabits

Every beauty and greatness in this world is created by a single thought or emotion inside a man Every thing we see today made by past generations was before its appearance a thought in the mind of a man or an impulse in the heart of a woman

Be brave enough to live creatively The creative is the place where no one else has ever been You have to leave the city of your comfort and go into the wilderness of your intuition You cannot get there by bus only by hard work risking and by not quite knowing what you are doing What you will discover will be wonderful yourself

Be not afraid of life Believe that life is worth living and your belief will help create the fact

The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid

Peace at any price

Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men

If they want peace nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede cannonshots

Her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace

Mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other

Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within they palaces

If peace cannot be maintained with honor it is no longer peace

Peace won by compromise is usually a shortlived achievement

If the pursuit of peace is both old and new it is also both complicated and simple It is complicated for it has to do with people and nothing in this universe baffles man as much as man himself

The wardrum throbbd no longer and the battleflags were furld In the parliament of man the federation of the world

The second sober thought of the people is seldom wrong and always efficient

When everything has to be right something isnt

The maxim Nothing avails but perfection may be spelled Paralysis

Perfectionism is a dangerous state of mind in an imperfect world

Perfectionism is slow death

Perfect order is the forerunner of perfect horror

The man who makes no mistakes lacks boldness and the spirit of adventure He never tries anything new He is a brake on the wheels of progress

I only have to stop the puck not beat it to death

Until I die Im going to keep doing My people need me They need somebody thats not taking from them and is giving them something

Be like a postage stampstick to one thing until you get there

Keep on going and the chances are that you will stumble on something perhaps when you are least expecting it I never heard of anyone ever stumbling on something sitting down

With ordinary talent and extraordinary perseverance all things are attainable

For me at least there came moments when faith wavered But there is the great lesson and the great triumph keep the fire burning until by and by out of the mass of sordid details there comes some result

Philanthropies and charities have a certain air of quackery

Steal the hog and give the feet for alms

I was eyes to the blind and feet was I to the lame

All philosophy lies in two words sustain and abstain

In philosophy an individual is becoming himself

Romanticism is the expression of mans urge to rise above reason and common sense just as rationalism is the expression of his urge to rise above theology and emotion

Science is what you know philosophy is what you dont know

Here is the beginning of philosophy a recognition of the conflicts between men a search for their cause a condemnation of mere opinion and the discovery of a standard of judgement

Anything that comes easy comes wrong

To teach how to live with uncertainty and yet without being paralyzed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy in our age can still do for those who study it

A man of business may talk of philosophy a man who has none may practise it

Philosophy the purple bullfinch in the lilac tree

Philosophy has a fine saying for everything for Death it has an entire set

Three passions simple but overwhelmingly strong have governed my life the longing for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind

I have a simple philosophy Fill whats empty Empty whats full And scratch where it itches

In North America there is the general belief that everything can be fixed that life can be fixed up In Europe the view is that a lot cant be fixed up and that living properly is not necessarily a question of mastering the technology so much as learning to live gracefully within the constraints that the species invents

Instead of just recording reality photographs have become the norm for the way things appear to us thereby changing the very idea of reality and of realism

The virtue of the camera is not the power it has to transform the photographer into an artist but the impulse it gives him to keep on looking

You see someone on the street and essentially what you notice about them is the flaw

If you scratch a great photograph you find two things a painting and a photograph

The camera makes everyone a tourist in other peoples reality and eventually in ones own

Photography records the gamut of feelings written on the human face the beauty of the earth and skies that man has inherited and the wealth and confusion man has created It is a major force in explaining man to man

All I wanted was to connect my moods with those of Paris Beauty pains and when it pained most I shot

Photographers deal in things which are continually vanishing and when they have vanished there is no contrivance on earth which can make them come back again

Photographers along with dentists are the two professions never satisfied with what they do Every dentist would like to be a doctor and inside every photographer is a painter trying to get out

Life is not about significant details illuminated in a flash fixed forever Photographs are

I really believe there are things nobody would see if I didnt photograph them

More helpful than all wisdom is one draught of simple human pity that will not forsake us

He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again

The rule of my life is to make business a pleasure and pleasure my business

There is no pleasure without a tincture of bitterness

He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man

No man was ever yet a great poet without at the same time being a profound philosopher

All men are poets at heart

Modern poets mix too much water with their ink

The man is either mad or he is making verses

All that is best in the great poets of all countries is not what is national in them but what is universal

Every man is a poet when he is in love

Poets have a license to lie

Villon our sad bad glad mad brothers name

Poetry the eldest sister of all arts and parent of most

Poetry is the Devils wine

Poetry therefore we will call Musical Thought

All that is not prose passes for poetry

Oh love will make a dog howl in rhyme

With me poetry has not been a purpose but a passion

I consider poetry very subordinate to moral and political science

The reader who is illuminated is in a real sense the poem

One merit of poetry few persons will deny it says more and in fewer words than prose

Publishing a volume of verse is like dropping a rosepetal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo

I was promised on a time To have reason for my rhyme From that time unto this season I received nor rhyme nor reason

Poetry is an echo asking a shadow to dance

A drainless shower of light is poesy tis the supreme of power tis might half slumbring on its own right arm

In poetry you must love the words the ideas and the images and rhythms with all your capacity to love anything at all

One of Wordsworths Lake District neighbours remarked upon hearing of the poets death I suppose his son will carry on the business

Poetry is not a profession its a destiny

Poetry is the language of a state of crisis

Poetry must be as new as foam and as old as the rock

Poets and painters are outside the class system or rather they constitute a special class of their own like the circus people and the gypsies

The mind that finds its way to wild places is the poets but the mind that never finds its way back is the lunatics

When a poets mind is perfectly equipped for its work it is constantly amalgamating disparate experiences

When I feel inclined to read poetry I take down my dictionary The poetry of words is quite as beautiful as that of sentences The author may arrange the gems effectively but their shape and lustre have been given by the attrition of ages

I dont really feel my poems are mine at all I didnt create them out of nothing I owe them to my relations with other people

Theres no money in poetry but then theres no poetry in money either

The essentials of poetry are rhythm dance and the human voice

Colour which is the poets wealth is so expensive that most take to mere outline sketches and become men of science

A poet dares to be just so clear and no clearer he approaches lucid ground warily like a mariner who is determined not to scrape his bottom on anything solid A poets pleasure is to withhold a little of his meaning to intensify by mystification He unzips the veil from beauty but does not remove it A poet utterly clear is a trifle glaring

Most joyful let the Poet be it is through him that all men see

Most people do not believe in anything very much and our greatest poetry is given to us by those that do

The poet is the priest of the invisible

A good poet is someone who manages in a lifetime of standing out in thunderstorms to be struck by lightning five or six times

Poetry should be common in experience but uncommon in books

For what is a poem but a hazardous attempt at selfunderstanding it is the deepest part of autobiography

When a great poet has lived certain things have been done once for all and cannot be achieved again

Before verse can be human again it must learn to be brutal

No honest poet can ever feel quite sure of the permanent value of what he has written he may have wasted his time and messed up his life for nothing

Poetry is all nouns and verbs

I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry that is prose words in their best order poetry the best words in their best order

When you write in prose you say what you mean When you write in rhyme you say what you must

The courage of the poet is to keep ajar the door that leads into madness

Science is for those who learn poetry for those who know

Popular poets are the parish priests of the Muse retailing her ancient divinations to a long since converted public

Reason respects the differences and imagination the similitudes of things

The poets mind is a receptacle for seizing and storing up numberless feelings phrases images which remain there until all the particles which can unite to form a new compound are present together

Of our conflicts with others we make rhetoric of our conflicts with ourselves we make poetry

Poetry is a mugs game

A poem begins with a lump in the throat a homesickness or alovesickness It is a reachingout toward expression an effort to find fulfillment A complete poem is one where an emotion has found its thought and the thought has found words

An art in which the artist by means of rhythm and great sincerity can convey to others the sentiment which he feels about life

Not reading poetry amounts to a national pastime here

It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skilfully

Writing free verse is like playing tennis with the net down

To have great poets there must be great audiences too

Poets arent very useful because they arent consumeful or very produceful

Politeness is a tacit agreement that peoples miserable defects whether moral or intellectual shall on either side be ignored and not be made the subject of reproach

Good manners are made up of petty sacrifices

Manners are the hypocrisy of a nation

Politeness is good nature regulated by good sense

If a man didnt make sense the Scotch felt it was misplaced politeness to try to keep him from knowing it Better that he be aware of his reputation for this would encourage reticence which goes well with stupidity

A man must have very eminent qualities to hold his own without being polite

Ah men do not know how much strength is in poise that he goes the farthest who goes far enough

Questioning is not the mode of conversation among gentlemen

It doesnt matter what you do in the bedroom as long as you dont do it in the streets and frighten the horses

There is always a best way of doing everything if it be only to boil an egg Manners are the happy ways of doing things

There is not a single outward mark of courtesy that does not have a deep moral basis

Good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of ourselves and how little we think of the other person

I cant stand a naked light bulb any more than I can stand a rude remark or a vulgar action

Rudeness is the weak mans imitation of strength

Chivalry is the most delicate form of contempt

A true gentlemen is one who is never unintentionally rude

Chivalry is a poor substitute for justice if one cannot have both Chivalry is something like the icing on cake sweet but not nourishing

A gentleman is any man who wouldnt hit a woman with his hat on

This is the final test of a gentleman his respect for those who can be of no possible service to him

The attributes of a great lady may still be found in the rule of the four Ss Sincerity Simplicity Sympathy and Serenity

This is the first convention of the space age where a candidate can promise the moon and mean it

90 of the politicians give the other 10 a bad reputation

A politician is a person with whose politics you dont agree if you agree with him he is a statesman

All political lives unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure

Politicians are the same all over They promise to build a bridge even where there is no river

Probably the most distinctive characteristic of the successful politician is selective cowardice

Reagan won because he ran against Jimmy Carter Had he run unopposed he would have lost

Successful democratic politicians are insecure and intimidated men They advance politically only as they placate appease bribe seduce bamboozle or otherwise manage to manipulate the demanding and threatening elements in their constituencies

The British House of Lords is the British Outer Mongolia for retired politicians

The first requirement of a statesman is that he be dull This is not always easy to achieve

I have said what I meant and meant what I said I have not done as well as I should like to have done but I have done my best frankly and forthrightly no man can do more and you are entitled to no less

It is never too late to be what you might have been

I will say this about being an optimist even when things dont turn out well you are certain they will get better

Love for a dog during childhood is one of the deepest and purest emotions we are ever likely to have and it remains with us for the rest of our lives For some people their first experience with love is with a dog The fact that the dog returns the love so fiercely so openly so unambivalently is for many children a unique and lasting experience

He who gladly does without the praise of the crowd will not miss the opportunity of becoming his own fan

Mr President I am praying for you Which way Senator

We offer up prayers to God only because we have made Him after our own image We treat Him like a Pasha or a Sultan who is capable of being exasperated and appeased

The fewer the words the better the prayer

In prayer we call ourselves worms of the dust but it is only on a sort of tacit understanding that the remark shall not be taken at par

Give us grace and strength to preserve Give us courage and gaiety and the quiet mind Spare to us our friends and soften to us our enemies Give us the strength to encounter that which is to come that we may be brave in peril constant in tribulation temperate in wrath and in all changes of fortune and down to the gates of death loyal and loving to one another

The first purpose of prayer is to know God

We one and all of us have an instinct to pray and this fact constitutes an invitation from God to pray

Teach us to pray that we may cause The enemy to flee That we his evil power may bind His prisoners to free

No matter what may be the test God will take care of you Lean weary one upon His breast God will take care of you

Prayer honors God acknowledges His being exalts His power adores His providence secures His aid

The whole meaning of prayer is that we may know God

Prayer crowns God with the honor and glory due to His name and God crowns prayer with assurance and comfort The most praying souls are the most assured souls

The purpose of prayer is to reveal the presence of God equally present all the time in every condition

The value of consistent prayer is not that He will hear us but that we will hear Him

Prayer is the force as real as terrestrial gravity As a physician I have seen men after all other therapy had failed lifted out of disease and melancholy by the serene effort of prayer Only in prayer do we achieve that complete and harmonious assembly of body mind and spirit which gives the frail human reed its unshakable strength

Prayer is not an old womans idle amusement Properly understood and applied it is the most potent instrument of action

Today any successful and competent businessman will employ the latest and besttested methods in production distribution and administration and many are discovering that one of the greatest of all efficiency methods is prayer power

To have a curable illness and to leave it untreated except for prayer is like sticking your hand in a fire and asking God to remove the flame

One night alone in prayer might make us new men changed from poverty of soul to spiritual wealth from trembling to triumphing

Every time we pray our horizon is altered our attitude to things is altered not sometimes but every time and the amazing thing is that we dont pray more

It is not so true that prayer changes things as that prayer changes me and I change things God has so constituted things that prayer on the basis of Redemption alters the way in which a man looks at things Prayer is not a question of altering things externally but of working wonders in a mans disposition

Prayer may not change things for you but it for sure changes you for things

The main lesson about prayer is just this Do it Do it Do it You want to be taught to pray My answer is pray

Praying is learned by praying

The only way to pray is to pray and the way to pray well is to pray much

The less I pray the harder it gets the more I pray the better it goes

Prayer is a trade to be learned We must be apprentices and serve our time at it Painstaking care much thought practice and labour are required to be a skillful tradesman in praying Practice in this as well as in all other trades makes perfect

If we are willing to spend hours on end to learn to play the piano operate a computer or fly an airplane it is sheer nonsense for us to imagine that we can learn the high art of getting guidance through communion with the Lord without being willing to set aside time for it

The great thing in prayer is to feel that we are putting our supplications into the bosom of omnipotent love

All the prayers in the Scripture you will find to be reasoning with God not a multitude of words heaped together

Scream at God if thats the only thing that will get results

You need not cry very loud he is nearer to us than we think

Rejoice always pray constantly and in all circumstances give thanks

God tells us to burden him with whatever burdens us

Do I want to pray or only to think about my human problems Do I want to pray or simply kneel there contemplating my sorrow Do I want to direct my prayer toward God or let it direct itself towards me

O thou by whom we come to God The Life the Truth the Way The path of prayer Thyself hast trod Lord teach us how to pray

Dealing in generalities is the death of prayer

Dont try to reach God with your understanding that is impossible Reach him in love that is possible

The right way to pray then is any way that allows us to communicate with God

He prayeth well who loveth well Both man and bird and beast He prayeth best who loveth best All things both great and small For the dear God who loveth us He made and loveth all

Natural ability and educational advantages do not figure as factors in this matter of prayer but a capacity for faith the power of a thorough consecration the ability of selflittleness an absolute losing of ones self in Gods glory and an ever present and insatiable yearning and seeking after all the fullness of God

We have to pray with our eyes on God not on the difficulties

If our petitions are in accordance with His will and if we seek His glory in the asking the answers will come in ways that will astonish us and fill our hearts with songs of thanksgiving

Pray if thou canst with hope but ever pray though hope be weak or sick with long delay pray in the darkness if there be no light and if for any wish thou dare not pray then pray to God to cast that wish away

Prayer can assume very different forms from quiet blessed contemplation of God in which eye meets eye in restful meditation to deep sighs or sudden exclamations of wonder joy gratitude or adoration

To pray is nothing more involved than to open the door giving Jesus access to our needs and permitting Him to exercise His own power in dealing with them

He prays best who does not know that he is praying

When you cannot pray as you would pray as you can

If you cant pray as you want to pray as you can God knows what you mean

Pray till you pray

A day without prayer is a boast against God

Prayer should be the key of the day and the lock of the night

I care not what black spiritual crisis we may come through or what delightful spiritual Canaan we may enter no blessing of the Christian life becomes continually possessed unless we are men and women of regular daily unhurried secret lingerings in prayer

In the morning prayer is the key that opens to us the treasures of Gods mercies and blessings in the evening it is the key that shuts us up under His protection and safeguard

Prayer is a kind of calling home every day And there can come to you a serenity a feeling of athomeness in Gods universe a peace that the world can neither give nor disturb a fresh courage a new insight a holy boldness that youll never never get any other way

O God if in the day of battle I forget Thee do not Thou forget me

Seven days without prayer makes one weak

Lord you know how busy I must be this day If I forget you do not you forget me

We read of preaching the Word out of season but we do not read of praying out of season for that is never out of season

Let prayer be the key of the morning and the bolt at night

Evening and morning and at noon will I pray

Prayer should be the means by which I at all times receive all that I need and for this reason be my daily refuge my daily consolation my daily joy my source of rich and inexhaustible joy in life

As impossible as it is for us to take a breath in the morning large enough to last us until noon so impossible is it to pray in the morning in such a way as to last us until noon Let your prayers ascend to Him constantly audibly or silently as circumstances throughout the day permit

To God your every Want In instant Prayer display Pray always Pray and never faint Pray without ceasing Pray

Constant prayer quickly straightens out our thoughts

Teach us to pray often that we may pray oftener

Abiding fully means praying much

Pray always pray beneath sins heaviest load Prayer claims the blood from Jesus side that flowed Pray always pray though weary faint and lone Prayer nestles by the Fathers sheltering throne

When the knees are not often bent the feet soon slide

The more praying there is in the world the better the world will be the mightier the forces against evil everywhere

Those who always pray are necessary to those who never pray

Tomorrow I plan to work work from early until late In fact I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer

Begin to realize more and more that prayer is the most important thing you do You can use your time to no better advantage than to pray whenever you have an opportunity to do so either alone or with others while at work while at rest or while walking down the street Anywhere

It is impossible to conduct your life as a disciple without definite times of secret prayer

Sometimes we think we are too busy to pray That is a great mistake for praying is a saving of time

Prayer time must be kept up as duly as mealtime

The minds of people are so cluttered up with everyday living these days that they dont or wont take time out for a little prayerfor mental cleansing just as they take a bath for physical outer cleansing Both are necessary

The Christian will find his parentheses for prayer even in the busiest hours of life

Time spent in prayer is never wasted

No time is so well spent in every day as that which we spend upon our knees

Other duties become pressing and absorbing and crowd our prayer Choked to death would be the coroners verdict in many cases of dead praying if an inquest could be secured on this dire spiritual calamity

When it becomes clear to us that prayer is a part of our daily program of work it will also become clear to us that we must arrange our daily program in such a way that there is time also for this work just as we set aside time for other necessary things such as eating and dressing

I have to hurry all day to get time to pray

While others still slept He went away to pray and to renew His strength in communion with His Father He had need of this otherwise He would not have been ready for the new day The holy work of delivering souls demands constant renewal through fellowship with God

And in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed

Get into the habit of dealing with God about everything Unless in the first waking moment of the day you learn to fling the door wide back and let God in you will work on a wrong level all day but swing the door wide open and pray to your Father in secret and every public thing will be stamped with the presence of God

It is by no haphazard chance that in every age men have risen early to pray The first thing that marks decline in spiritual life is our relationship to the early morning

The entire day receives order and discipline when it acquires unity This unity must be sought and found in morning prayer The morning prayer determines the day

Cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning

In the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee

If you have ever prayed in the dawn you will ask yourself why you were so foolish as not to do it always it is difficult to get into communion with God in the midst of the hurlyburly of the day

I feel it is far better to begin with God to see His face first to get my soul near Him before it is near another In general it is best to have at least one hour alone with God before engaging in anything else

Lord if any have to die this day let it be me for I am ready

Temptations which accompany the working day will be conquered on the basis of the morning breakthrough to God Decisions demanded by work become easier and simpler where they are made not in the fear of men but only in the sight of God He wants to give us today the power which we need for our work

The man who says his prayers in the evening is a captain posting his sentries After that he can sleep

When at night you cannot sleep talk to the Shepherd and stop counting sheep

I did this night promise my wife never to go to bed without calling upon God upon my knees in prayer

I have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had nowhere else to go My own wisdom and that of all about me seemed insufficient for the day

There are no atheists on turbulent airplanes

Ordinarily when a man in difficulty turns to prayer he has already tried every other means of escape

When life knocks you to your knees and it will why get up If it knocks you to your knees again as it will well isnt that the best position from which to pray

Now I am past all comforts here but prayer

Prayer begins where human capacity ends

Oh God if I were sure I were to die tonight I would repent at once It is the commonest prayer in all languages

If you are swept off your feet its time to get on your knees

When I am weak then am I strong

To pray is to open the door unto Jesus and admit Him into your distress Your helplessness is the very thing which opens wide the door unto Him and gives Him access to all your needs

My helpless friend your helplessness is the most powerful plea which rises up to the tender fatherheart of God You think that everything is closed to you because you cannot pray My friend your helplessness is the very essence of prayer

Listen my friend Your helplessness is your best prayer It calls from your heart to the heart of God with greater effect than all your uttered pleas He hears it from the very moment that you are seized with helplessness and He becomes actively engaged at once in hearing and answering the prayer of your helplessness

Helplessness is unquestionably the first and the surest indication of a praying heart Prayer and helplessness are inseparable Only he who is helpless can truly pray

When we pray for the Spirits help we will simply fall down at the Lords feet in our weakness There we will find the victory and power that comes from His love

The more helpless you are the better you are fitted to pray and the more answers to prayer you will experience

Being in an agony he prayed more earnestly

When a man is at his wits end it is not a cowardly thing to pray it is the only way he can get in touch with Reality

When my soul fainted within me my prayer came in unto thee

He will regard the prayer of the destitute

My strength is made perfect in weakness

God listens to our weeping when the occasion itself is beyond our knowledge but still within His love and power

Trouble and prayer are closely related Trouble often drives men to God in prayer while prayer is but the voice of men in trouble

Trouble and perplexity drive me to prayer and prayer drives away perplexity and trouble

An agnostic found himself in trouble and a friend suggested he pray How can I pray when I do not know whether or not there is a God he asked If you are lost in the forest his friend replied you do not wait until you find someone before shouting for help

Many people pray as if God were a big aspirin pill they come only when they hurt

You pray in your distress and in your need would that you might also pray in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance

Dont pray when it rains if you dont pray when the sun shines

He who cannot pray when the sun is shining will not know how to pray when the clouds come

All those football coaches who hold dressingroom prayers before a game should be forced to attend church once a week

Prayer is not merely an occasional impulse to which we respond when we are in trouble prayer is a life attitude

Do not have as your motive the desire to be known as a praying man Get an inner chamber in which to pray where no one knows you are praying shut the door and talk to God in secret

Nowhere can we get to know the holiness of God and come under His influence and power except in the inner chamber It has been well said No man can expect to make progress in holiness who is not often and long alone with God

Private place and plenty of time are the life of prayer

But thou when thou prayest enter into thy room and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy Father who is in secret and thy Father who seeth in secret shall reward thee openly

When you enter your secret chamber take plenty of time before you begin to speak Let quietude wield its influence upon you Let the fact that you are alone assert itself Give your soul time to get released from the many outward things Give God time to play the prelude to prayer for the benefit of your distracted soul

There is no need to get to a place of prayer pray wherever you are

Of all things guard against neglecting God in the secret place of prayer

Prayer to the patriarchs and prophets was more than the recital of wellknown and wellworn phrasesit was the outpouring of the heart

Without the incense of heartfelt prayer even the greatest of cathedrals is dead

Follow your own way of speaking to our Lord sincerely lovingly confidently and simply as your heart dictates

Sincerity is the prime requisite in every approach to the God who hates all hypocrisy falsehood and deceit

The Lords Prayer may be committed to memory quickly but it is slowly learnt by heart

God hears no more than the heart speaks and if the heart be dumb God will certainly be dumb

Deep down in me I knowed it was a lie and He knowed it You cant pray a lieI found that out

Prayers not felt by us are seldom heard by God

Many pray with their lips for that for which their hearts have no desire

God may turn his ears from prattling prayers or preaching prayers but never from penitent believing prayers

Two went to pray Better to say one went to brag the other to pray

I pray like a robber asking alms at the door of a farmhouse to which he is ready to set fire

Gods ear lies close to the believers lip

Heaven is never deaf but when mans heart is dumb

Do not pray by heart but with the heart

Our prayers must mean something to us if they are to mean anything to God

Our prayers must spring from the indigenous soil of our own personal confrontation with the Spirit of God in our lives

God eagerly awaits the chance to bless the person whose heart is turned toward Him

We must lay before him what is in us not what ought to be in us

In prayer the lips neer act the winning part without the sweet concurrence of the heart

The cry of a young raven is nothing but the natural cry of a creature but your cry if it be sincere is the result of a work of grace in your heart

Every time you pray if your prayer is sincere there will be new feeling and new meaning in it which will give you fresh courage and you will understand that prayer is an education

When you pray rather let your heart be without words than your words without heart

He offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea

Prayer is a serious thing We may be taken at our words

Prayer at its best is the expression of the total life for all things else being equal our prayers are only as powerful as our lives

And help us this and every day to live more nearly as we pray

My words fly up my thoughts remain below Words without thoughts never to heaven go

It is not well for a man to pray cream and live skim milk

She heard the snuffle of hypocrisy in her prayer She had to cease to pray

None can pray well but he that lives well

Straight praying is never born of crooked conduct

A wicked man in prayer may lift up his hands but he cannot lift up his face

He who prays as he ought will endeavor to live as he prays

We pray pious blether our will is not in it and then we say God does not answer we never asked Him for anything Asking means that our wills are in what we ask

It is good for us to keep some account of our prayers that we may not unsay them in our practice

Praying which does not result in pure conduct is a delusion We have missed the whole office and virtue of praying if it does not rectify conduct It is in the very nature of things that we must quit praying or quit bad conduct

Our praying to be strong must be buttressed by holy living The life of faith perfects the prayer of faith

Search me O God and know my heart try me and know my thoughts and see if there be any wicked way in me

When our will wholeheartedly enters into the prayer of Christ then we pray correctly

We cannot talk to God strongly when we have not lived for God strongly The closet cannot be made holy to God when the life has not been holy to God

If we would have God in the closet God must have us out of the closet There is no way of praying to God but by living to God

Men would pray better if they lived better They would get more from God if they lived more obedient and wellpleasing to God

Be not hot in prayer and cold in praise

Though smooth be the heartless prayer no ear in heaven will mind it And the finest phrase falls dead if there is no feeling behind it

Prayer is the souls sincere desire

Prayer is not eloquence but earnestness not the definition of helplessness but the feeling of it not figures of speech but earnestness of soul

Prayer is something deeper than words It is present in the soul before it has been formulated in words And it abides in the soul after the last words of prayer have passed over our lips

If we rely on the Holy Spirit we shall find that our prayers become more and more inarticulate and when they are inarticulate reverence grows deeper and deeper

God prefers bad verses recited with a pure heart to the finest verses chanted by the wicked

We cannot all argue but we can all pray we cannot all be leaders but we can all be pleaders we cannot all be mighty in rhetoric but we can all be prevalent in prayer

The best prayers have often more groans than words

In prayer it is better to have a heart without words than words without a heart

We ought to act with God in the greatest simplicity speak to Him frankly and plainly and implore His assistance in our affairs

Prayer is not artful monologue Of voice uplifted from the son It is Loves tender dialogue Between the soul and God

They tell about a fifteenyearold boy in an orphans home who had an incurable stutter One Sunday the minister was detained and the boy volunteered to say the prayer in his stead He did it perfectly too without a single stutter Later he explained I dont stutter when I talk to God He loves me

Our groanings which cannot be uttered rise to Him and tell Him better than words how dependent we are upon Him

When prayer is a struggle do not worry about the prayers that you cannot pray You yourself are a prayer to God at that moment All that is within you cries out to Him And He hears all the pleas that your suffering soul and body are making to Him with groanings which cannot be uttered

God can pick sense out of a confused prayer

Prayer requires more of the heart than of the tongue

Productive prayer requires earnestness not eloquence

Just pray for a tough hide and a tender heart

Prayer is a fine delicate instrument To use it right is a great art a holy art There is perhaps no greater art than the art of prayer Yet the least gifted the uneducated and the poor can cultivate the holy art of prayer

With God there is no need for long speeches

The fewer the words the better the prayer

In prayer more is accomplished by listening than by talking

Prayer should be short without giving God Almighty reasons why He should grant this or that He knows best what is good for us

God is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few

Many words do not a good prayer make what counts is the heartfelt desire to commune with God and the faith to back it up

A little lifting of the heart suffices a little remembrance of God one act of inward worship are prayers which however short are nevertheless acceptable to God

There come times when I have nothing more to tell God If I were to continue to pray in words I would have to repeat what I have already said At such times it is wonderful to say to God May I be in Thy presence Lord I have nothing more to say to Thee but I do love to be in Thy presence

Short prayers pierceth Heaven

You are coming to a King Large petitions with you bring For his grace and power are such None can ever ask too much

There is no sinner in the world however much at enmity with God who cannot recover Gods grace by recourse to Mary and by asking her assistance

Most Christians expect little from God ask little and therefore receive little and are content with little

Ye have not because ye ask not

Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss

Ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you

Whether we like it or not asking is the rule of the Kingdom

The simple heart that freely asks in love obtains

Our immediate temptation will be to ask for specific solutions to specific problems and for the ability to help other people as we have already thought they should be helped In that case we are asking God to do it our way

It is the will of our heavenly Father that we should come to Him freely and confidently and make known our desires to Him just as we would have our children come freely and of their own accord and speak to us about the things they would like to have

My praying friend continue to make known your desires to God in all things Let Him decide whether you are to receive what you ask for or not

Let your requests be made known unto God

Pray for whatsoever you will In the name of Jesus you have permission not only to stand in the presence of God but also to pray for everything you need

And whatever ye shall ask in my name that will I do

We should not be afraid when praying to God to give expression to a definite desire even though we are in doubt at the time we are praying whether it is really the right thing to pray for or not

We can never know God as it is our privilege to know Him by brief repetitions that are requests for personal favors and nothing more

Prayer is not only asking it is an attitude of heart that produces an atmosphere in which asking is perfectly natural and Jesus says every one that asketh receiveth

Helplessness becomes prayer the moment that you go to Jesus and speak candidly and confidently with him about your needs This is to believe

The clue is not to ask in a miserly waythe key is to ask in a grand manner

To avail yourself of His certain wisdom ask of Him whatever questions you have But do not entreat Him for that will never be necessary

O Lord attend unto my cry

We pray pious blether our will is not in it and then we say God does not answer we never asked Him for anything Asking means that our wills are in what we ask

Ask the gods nothing excessive

When praying for healing ask great things of God and expect great things from God But let us seek for that healing that really matters the healing of the heart enabling us to trust God simply face God honestly and live triumphantly

Most people do not pray they only beg

Prayer is not asking It is a longing of the soul

Prayer in the sense of petition asking for things is a small part of it confession and penitence are its threshold adoration its sanctuary the presence and vision and enjoyment of God its bread and wine

God never denied that soul anything that went as far as heaven to ask it

Ask in faith

If your prayer is selfish the answer will be something that will rebuke your selfishness You may not recognize it as having come at all but it is sure to be there

Selfishness is never so exquisitely selfish as when it is on its knees Self turns what would otherwise be a pure and powerful prayer into a weak and ineffective one

I seldom made an errand to God for another but I got something for myself

When we make self the end of prayer it is not worship but selfseeking

We look upon prayer as a means of getting things for ourselves The Bible idea of prayer is that we may get to know God Himself

Pray for one another

Intercessory prayer for one who is sinning prevails God says so The will of the man prayed for does not come into question at all he is connected with God by prayer and prayer on the basis of the Redemption sets the connection working and God gives life

He who prays for his neighbors will be heard for himself

We should say to God as we mingle with our dear ones each day God give them each Thy blessing They need it because they live with me and I am very selfish and unwilling to sacrifice very much for them although I do love them

See to it night and day that you pray for your children Then you will leave them a great legacy of answers to prayer which will follow them all the days of their life Then you may calmly and with a good conscience depart from them even though you may not leave them a great deal of material wealth

Religion without humanity is a poor human stuff

God bless all those that I love God bless all those that love me God bless all those that love those that I love and all those that love those that love me

No one who has had a unique experience with prayer has a right to withhold it from others

Thou who has given so much to me give one thing more a grateful heart

If the only prayer you say in your whole life is Thank you that would suffice

Pray without ceasing In everything give thanks

Fear of trouble present and future often blinds us to the numerous small blessings we enjoy silencing our prayers of praise and thanksgiving

God deserves far more praise than any of us could ever give Him

Our Father let the spirit of gratitude so prevail in our hearts that we may manifest thy Spirit in our lives

A sensible thanksgiving for mercies received is a mighty prayer in the Spirit of God It prevails with Him unspeakably

God receives little thanks even for his greatest gifts

It is not only blessed to give thanks it is also of vital importance to our prayer life in general If we have noted the Lords answers to our prayers and thanked Him for what we have received of Him then it becomes easier for us and we get more courage to pray for more

To stand on one leg and prove Gods existence is a very different thing from going down on ones knees and thanking him

Our thanks to God should always precede our requests

Jesus is moved to happiness every time He sees that you appreciate what He has done for you Grip His pierced hand and say to Him I thank Thee Savior because Thou hast died for me Thank Him likewise for all the other blessings He has showered upon you from day to day It brings joy to Jesus

The idea of thanking staff should mean giving them something that they would never buy for themselves

Let us thank God heartily as often as we pray that we have His Spirit in us to teach us to pray Thanksgiving will draw our hearts out to God and keep us engaged with Him it will take our attention from ourselves and give the Spirit room in our hearts

Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving

When we succeed in truly thanking God we feel good at heart The reason is that we have been created to give glory to God now and forevermore And every time we do so we feel that we are in harmony with His plans and purposes for our lives Then we are truly in our element That is why it is so blessed

Dont be timid when you pray rather batter the very gates of heaven with storms of prayer

Let him never cease from prayer who has once begun it be his life ever so wicked for prayer is the way to amend it and without prayer such amendment will be much more difficult

How those holy men of old could storm the battlements above When there was no way to look but up they lifted up their eyes to God who made the hills with unshakable confidence

Cold prayers shall never have any warm answers

We must wrestle earnestly in prayer like men contending with a deadly enemy for life

We may as well not pray at all as offer our prayers in a lifeless manner

There is neither encouragement nor room in Bible religion for feeble desires listless efforts lazy attitudes all must be strenuous urgent ardent Flamed desires impassioned unwearied insistence delight heaven God would have His children incorrigibly in earnest and persistently bold in their efforts Heaven is too busy to listen to halfhearted prayers or to respond to popcalls Our whole being must be in our praying

It is only when the whole heart is gripped with the passion of prayer that the lifegiving fire descends for none but the earnest man gets access to the ear of God

To say prayers in a decent delicate way is not heavy work But to pray really to pray till hell feels the ponderous stroke to pray till the iron gates of difficulty are opened till the mountains of obstacles are removed till the mists are exhaled and the clouds are lifted and the sunshine of a cloudless day brightensthis is hard work but it is Gods work and mans best labor

Importunity is a condition of prayer We are to press the matter not with vain repetitions but with urgent repetitions We repeat not to count the times but to gain the prayer We cannot quit praying because heart and soul are in it We pray with all perseverance We hang to our prayers because by them we live We press our pleas because we must have them or die

The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much

From silly devotions and from sourfaced saints good Lord deliver us

Let me burn out for God prayer is the great thing Oh that I may be a man of prayer

Look as a painted man is no man and as painted fire is no fire so a cold prayer is no prayer

There must be fired affections before our prayers will go up

Bear up the hands that hang down by faith and prayer support the tottering knees Storm the throne of grace and persevere therein and mercy will come down

Do not work so hard for Christ that you have no strength to pray for prayer requires strength

In Fellowship alone To God with Faith draw near Approach His Courts besiege His Throne With all the power of Prayer

Productive prayer requires earnestness not eloquence

Jesus taught that perseverance is the essential element of prayer Men must be in earnest when they kneel at Gods footstool Too often we get fainthearted and quit praying at the point where we ought to begin We let go at the very point where we should hold on strongest Our prayers are weak because they are not impassioned by an unfailing and resistless will

We must move from asking God to take care of the things that are breaking our hearts to praying about the things that are breaking His heart

We cannot ask in behalf of Christ what Christ would not ask Himself if He were praying

Thou who has given so much to me give one thing more a grateful heart

We do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy

Our prayers should be for blessings in general for God knows best what is good for us

Lord take my lips and speak through them take my mind and think through it take my heart and set it on fire

Not what we wish but what we need Oh let your grace supply The good unasked in mercy grant The ill though asked deny

We should pray for a sane mind in a sound body

If we are to pray aright perhaps it is quite necessary that we pray contrary to our own heart Not what we want to pray is important but what God wants us to pray The richness of the Word of God ought to determine our prayer not the poverty of our heart

O Lord help me not to despise or oppose what I do not understand

We are going home to many who cannot read So Lord make us to be Bibles so that those who cannot read the Book can read it in us

Gods promises are to be our pleas in prayer

Help me to work and pray Help me to live each day That all I do may say Thy kingdom come

We must pray for more prayer for it is the worlds mightiest healing force

O Lord let me not live to be useless

God give me work till my life shall end And life till my work is done

The whole meaning of prayer is that we may know God

Watch your motive before God have no other motive in prayer than to know Him

For we know not what we should pray for

Pray a little each day in a childlike way for the Spirit of prayer If you feel that you know as yet very little concerning the deep things of prayer and what prayer really is then pray for the Spirit of prayer There is nothing He would rather do than unveil to you the grace of prayer

God does not exist to answer our prayers but by our prayers we come to discern the mind of God

I sit beside my lonely fire and pray for wisdom yet for calmness to remember or courage to forget

The first petition that we are to make to Almighty God is for a good conscience the next for health of mind and then of body

When we in prayer seek only the glorification of the name of God then we are in complete harmony with the spirit of prayer Then our hearts are at rest both while we pray and after we have prayed Then we can wait for the Lord

Grant that we may not so much seek to be understood as to understand

Grant me the courage not to give up even though I think it is hopeless

Prayer for worldly goods is worse than fruitless but prayer for strength of soul is that passion of the soul which catches the gift it seeks

Just pray for a tough hide and a tender heart

The purpose of prayer is not to inform God of our needs but to invite Him to rule our lives

Dont pray to escape trouble Dont pray to be comfortable in your emotions Pray to do the will of God in every situation Nothing else is worth praying for

O Lord forgive what I have been sanctify what I am and order what I shall be

Spread out your petition before God and then say Thy will not mine be done The sweetest lesson I have learned in Gods school is to let the Lord choose for me

Show me your ways O Lord teach me your paths guide me in your truth and teach me for you are God my Savior and my hope is in you all day long

The possibilities of prayer are found in its allying itself with the purposes of God for Gods purposes and mans praying are the combination of all potent and omnipotent forces

If we ask anything according to his will he heareth us

I would have no desire other than to accomplish thy will Teach me to pray pray thyself in me

True prayer brings a persons will into accordance with Gods will not the other way around

Do not forget that prayer is ordained for the purpose of glorifying the name of God Therefore whether you pray for big things or for little things say to God If it will glorify Thy name then grant my prayer and help me

It is only when we pray for something according to the will of God that we have the promise of being heard and answered

I used to pray that God would do this or that now I pray that God will make His will known to me

How many of us will ever sit bow our heads and pray Lord show me where Im wrong

Women dont have halos built in

A Chinese Christian prayed every day Lord reform Thy world beginning with me

Create in me a clean heart O God

It is quite useless knocking at the door of heaven for earthly comfort Its not the sort of comfort they supply there

Pray not for lighter burdens but for stronger backs

Prayer covers the whole of mans life There is no thought feeling yearning or desire however low trifling or vulgar we may deem it which if it affects our real interest or happiness we may not lay before God and be sure of sympathy His nature is such that our often coming does not tire him The whole burden of the whole life of every man may be rolled on to God and not weary him though it has wearied man

What a friend we have in Jesus All our sins and griefs to bear What a privilege to carry Everything to God in Prayer Have we trials and temptations Is there trouble anywhere We should never be discouraged Take it to the Lord in prayer Are we weak and heavy laden Cumbered with a load of care Precious Savior still our refuge Take it to the Lord in prayer O what peace we often forfeit O what needless pain we bear All because we do not carry Everything to God in prayer

Prayer puts Gods work in his handsand keeps it there

I know not by what methods rare But this I know God answers prayer I know not if the blessing sought Will come in just the guise I thought I leave my prayer to Him alone Whose will is wiser than my own

Do what you can and pray for what you cannot yet do

Do not want things to turn out as they seem best to you but as God pleases Then you will be free from confusion and thankful in prayer

O Lord you know what is best for me Let this or that be done as you please Give what you will how much you will and when you will

Spread out your petition before God and then say Thy will not mine be done The sweetest lesson I have learned in Gods school is to let the Lord choose for me

Casting all your care upon Him for he careth for you

Do not strive in your own strength cast yourself at the feet of the Lord Jesus and wait upon Him in the sure confidence that He is with you and works in you Strive in prayer let faith fill your heartso will you be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might

A humble and contrite heart knows that it can merit nothing before God and that all that is necessary is to be reconciled to ones helplessness and let our holy and almighty God care for us just as an infant surrenders himself to his mothers care

Cast thy burden upon the Lord and he shall sustain thee

The only prayer which a wellmeaning man can pray is O ye gods give me whatever is fitting unto me

Our prayer life will become restful when it really dawns upon us that we have done all we are supposed to do when we have spoken to Him about it From the moment we have left it with Him it is His responsibility

God tells us to burden him with whatever burdens us

This is what I found out about religion It gives you courage to make decisions you must make in a crisis and then the confidence to leave the result to a Higher Power Only by trust in God can a man carrying responsibility find repose

Before we can pray Lord Thy Kingdom come we must be willing to pray My Kingdom go

We need to learn to know Him so well that we feel safe when we have left our difficulties with Him To know Jesus in that way is a prerequisite of all true prayer

No prayers can be heard which do not come from a forgiving heart

I firmly believe a great many prayers are not answered because we are not willing to forgive someone

When you pray for anyone you tend to modify your personal attitude toward him

When my children do wrong I ache to hear their stumbling requests for forgiveness Im sure our heavenly Father aches even more deeply to hear from us

There is nothing that makes us love a man so much as praying for him

Ask Gods blessing on your work but dont ask him to do it for you

Prayer indeed is good but while calling on the gods a man should himself lend a hand

Prayer among sane people has never superseded practical efforts to secure the desired end

It is vain to expect our prayers to be heard if we do not strive as well as pray

He who labors as he prays lifts his heart to God with his hands

Pray as if everything depended on God and work as if everything depended upon man

Work as if everything depended upon work and pray as if everything depended upon prayer

Help yourself and heaven will help you

Work as if you were to live one hundred years pray as if you were to die tomorrow

God helps those who help themselves

God help those who do not help themselves

God gives the nuts but he does not crack them

God gives every bird its food but he does not throw it into the nest

Pray devoutly but hammer stoutly

The Ancient Mariner said to Neptune during a great storm O God you will save me if you wish but I am going to go on holding my tiller straight

Pray to God but keep rowing to shore

Call on God but row away from the rocks

To the man who himself strives earnestly God also lends a helping hand

Trust in Allah but tie your camel first

It is vain to ask of the gods what man is capable of supplying for himself

Heaven neer helps the men who will not act

To give pleasure to a single heart by a single kind act is better than a thousand headbowings in prayer

Always look for ways to act upon the faith you display in your prayers

You can do more than pray after you have prayed but you cannot do more than pray until you have prayed

Visualize prayerize actionize and your wishes will come true

There is a time for all things a time to preach and a time to pray but those times have passed away there is a time to fight and that time has come

Prayer is often a temptation to bank on a miracle of God instead of on a moral issue ie it is much easier to ask God to do my work than it is to do it myself Until we are disciplined properly we will always be inclined to bank on Gods miracles and refuse to do the moral thing ourselves It is our job and it will never be done unless we do it

Some people think that prayer just means asking for things and if they fail to receive exactly what they asked for they think the whole thing is a fraud

Poverty chastity and obedience are extremely difficult But there are always the graces if you will pray for them

Real prayer seeks an audience and an answer

There are three answers to prayer yes no and wait awhile It must be recognized that no is an answer

There are four ways God answers prayer No not yet No I love you too much Yes I thought youd never ask Yes and heres more

No answer to prayer is an indication of our merit every answer to prayer is an indication of Gods mercy

God answers all true prayer either in kind or in kindness

God is not a cosmic bellboy for whom we can press a button to get things

More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of

When I have a problem I pray about it and what comes to mind and stays there I assume to be my answer And this has been right so often that I know it is Gods answer

Whenever the insistence is on the point that God answers prayer we are off the track The meaning of prayer is that we get hold of God not of the answer

I think Christians fail so often to get answers to their prayers because they do not wait long enough on God They just drop down and say a few words and then jump up and forget it and expect God to answer them Such praying always reminds me of the small boy ringing his neighbors doorbell and then running away as fast as he can go

When I pray coincidences happen and when I dont they dont

Our understanding of God is the answer to prayer getting things from God is Gods indulgence of us When God stops giving us things He brings us into the place where we can begin to understand Him

If God sees that my spiritual life will be furthered by giving the things for which I ask then He will give them but that is not the end of prayer The end of prayer is that I come to know God Himself

You say But He has not answered He has He is so near to you that His silence is the answer His silence is big with terrific meaning that you cannot understand yet but presently you will

When we pray in the Name of Jesus the answers are in accordance with His nature and if we think our prayers are unanswered it is because we are not interpreting the answer along this line

Gods silences are His answers If we only take as answers those that are visible to our senses we are in a very elementary condition of grace

Who rises from prayer a better man his prayer is answered

God has editing rights over our prayers He will edit them correct them bring them in line with His will and then hand them back to us to be resubmitted

The great tragedy of life is not unanswered prayer but unoffered prayer

My prayers my God flow from what I am not I think Thy answers make me what I am

The greatest blessing of prayer is not receiving the answer but being the kind of person God can trust with His answer

God answers prayer with certainty Wish fulfillment is something else

God delays but doesnt forget

A generous prayer is never presented in vain the petition may be refused but the petitioner is always I believe rewarded by some gracious visitation

I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just

The answer of our prayers is secured by the fact that in rejecting them God would in a certain sense deny His own nature

There are two main pitfalls on the road to mastery of the art of prayer If a person gets what he asks for his humility is in danger If he fails to get what he asks for he is apt to lose confidence Indeed no matter whether prayer seems to be succeeding or failing humility and confidence are two virtues which are absolutely essential

If we be empty and poor it is not because Gods hand is straitened but ours is not opened

I firmly believe a great many prayers are not answered because we are not willing to forgive someone

I know not by what methods rare But this I know God answers prayer I know not if the blessing sought Will come in just the guise I thought I leave my prayer to Him alone Whose will is wiser than my own

Our prayers are often filled with selfish wants God always answers with what we need

We ought not to tolerate for a minute the ghastly and grievous thought that God will not answer prayer

Though I am weak yet God when prayed Cannot withhold his conquering aid

Beyond our utmost wants His love and power can bless To praying souls he always grants More than they can express

Whatever things ye desire when ye pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them

The firmament of the Bible is ablaze with answers to prayer

Never was a faithful prayer lost Some prayers have a longer voyage than others but then they return with their richer lading at last so that the praying soul is a gainer by waiting for an answer

In Gethsemane the holiest of all petitioners prayed three times that a certain cup might pass from Him It did not After that the idea that prayer is recommended to us as a sort of infallible gimmick may be dismissed

Sometimes God answers our prayers in the way our parents do who reply to the pleas of their children with Not just now or Ill have to think about that for a little while

Answered prayers cover the field of providential history as flowers cover western prairies

In seasons of distress and grief My soul has often found relief And oft escaped the tempters snare By thy return sweet hour of prayer

God answers sharp and sudden on some prayers And thrusts the thing we have prayed for in our face A gauntlet with a gift int

Our prayers run along one road and Gods answers by another and by and by they meet

Gods chief gift to those who seek him is Himself

Asking for anything is allowed with the understanding that Gods answers come from Gods perspective They are not always in harmony with our expectations for only He knows the whole story

May the Lord answer you when you are in distress May the name of the God of Jacob protect you May he send you help from the sanctuary and grant you support from Zion

Just when I need Him He is my all Answering when upon Him I call Tenderly watching lest I should fall

The king shall joy in thy strength O Lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice Thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withheld the request of his lips

Those who trade with heaven by prayer grow rich by quick returns

The great thing in prayer is to feel that we are putting our supplications into the bosom of omnipotent love

When you go to your knees God will help you stand up to anything

Prayer has marked the trees across the wilderness of a skeptical world to direct the traveler in distress and all paths lead to a single light

The man who prays grows and the muscles of the soul swell from this whipcord to iron bands

Prayer opens our eyes that we may see ourselves and others as God sees us

It is impossible to lose your footing while on your knees

The exercise of prayer in those who habitually exert it must be regarded by us doctors as the most adequate and normal of all the pacifiers of the mind and calmers of the nerves

The influence of prayer on the human mind and body can be measured in terms of increased physical buoyancy greater intellectual vigor moral stamina and a deeper understanding of the realities underlying human relationships

The essence of prayer even of a mystical experience is the way we are altered to see everything from its lifefilled dimension

Prayer puts Gods work in His handsand keeps it there

It is hard to wait and press and pray and hear no voice but stay till God answers

Prayer is a kind of calling home every day And there can come to you a serenity a feeling of athomeness in Gods universe a peace that the world can neither give nor disturb a fresh courage a new insight a holy boldness that youll never never get any other way

Pray because you have a Father not because it quietens you and give Him time to answer

Perhaps one of the greatest rewards of meditation and prayer is the sense of belonging that comes to us

We impoverish God in our minds when we say there must be answers to our prayers on the material plane the biggest answers to our prayers are in the realm of the unseen

Our Lord never referred to unanswered prayer he taught that prayers are always answered He ever implied that prayers were answered rightly because of the Heavenly Fathers wisdom

As white snow flakes fall quietly and thickly on a winter day answers to prayer will settle down upon you at every step you take even to your dying day The story of your life will be the story of prayer and answers to prayer

God is a rich and bountiful Father and He does not forget His children nor withhold from them anything which it would be to their advantage to receive

Just as an earthly father knows what is best for his childrens welfare so does God take into consideration the particular needs of His human family and meets them out of His wonderful storehouse

Prayer brings a good spirit in our homes For God hears prayer Heaven itself would come down to our homes And even though we who constitute the home all have our imperfections and our failings our home would through Gods answer to prayer become a little paradise

Gods willingness to answer our prayers exceeds our willingness to give good and necessary things to our children just as far as Gods ability goodness and perfection exceed our infirmities and evil

The greatest answer to prayer is that I am brought into a perfect understanding with God and that alters my view of actual things

Gods nothings are His most positive answers We have to stay on God and wait Never try to help God to fulfill His word

The shower of answers to your prayers will continue to your dying hour Nor will it cease then When you pass out from beneath the shower your dear ones will step into it Every prayer and every sigh which you have uttered for them and their future welfare will in Gods time descend upon them as a gentle rain of answers to prayer

If a door slams shut it means that God is pointing to an open door further on down

We ignorant of ourselves beg often our own harms which the wise powers deny us for our good

Prayer is the easiest and hardest of all things the simplest and the sublimest the weakest and the most powerful its results lie outside the range of human possibilitiesthey are limited only by the omnipotence of God

Prayer like faith obtains promises enlarges their operation and adds to the measure of their results

If we will make use of prayer to call down upon ourselves and others those things which will glorify the name of God then we shall see the strongest and boldest promises of the Bible about prayer fulfilled Then we shall see such answers to prayer as we had never thought were possible

Let it be your business every day in the secrecy of the inner chamber to meet the holy God You will be repaid for the trouble it may cost you The reward will be sure and rich

One great effect of prayer is that it enables the soul to command the body By obedience I make my body submissive to my soul but prayer puts my soul in command of my body

If we pray for anything according to the will of God we already have what we pray for the moment we ask it We do not know exactly when it will arrive but we have learned to know God through the Spirit of God and have learned to leave this in His hands and to live just as happily whether the answer arrives immediately or later

It is Gods will not only to hear our prayer but to give us the best and the richest answer which He the almighty and omniscient God can devise He will send us the answer when it will benefit us and His cause the most

If God does not give you something you ask for wait on Him He will speak with you tenderly and sympathetically about the matter until you yourself understand that He cannot grant your prayer

More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered ones

True prayer always receives what it asks foror something better

Be thankful that Gods answers are wiser than your answers

God punishes us mildly by ignoring our prayers and severely by answering them

When the gods wish to punish us they answer our prayers

God alone fully understands what each one of us needs we make mistakes continually and pray for things which would be harmful to us if we received them Afterwards we see our mistakes and realize that God is good and wise in not giving us these things even though we plead ever so earnestly for them

When the gods are angry with a man they give him what he asks for

I have lived to thank God that all my prayers have not been answered

Faith is the fountain of prayer and prayer should be nothing else but faith exercised

When we pray we link ourselves with an inexhaustible motive power

Jesus Christ is a God whom we approach without pride and before whom we humble ourselves without despair

Granting that we are always in the presence of God yet it seems to me that those who pray are in His presence in a very different sense for they as it were see that He is looking upon them while others may go for days on end without even once recollecting that God sees them

Why is it when we talk to God were said to be praying but when God talks to us were schizophrenic

It is in recognizing the actual presence of God that we find prayer no longer a chore but a supreme delight

Essentially prayer is based on a relationship We dont converse freely with someone we dont know We bare our souls and disclose our hidden secrets only to someone we trust

When lifes problems seem overwhelming look around and see what other people are coping with You may consider yourself fortunate

If all our misfortunes were laid in one common heap whence everyone must take an equal portion most people would be content to take their own and depart

A problem well stated is a problem half solved

It isnt that they cant see the solution its that they cant see the problem

If we can really understand the problem the answer will come out of it because the answer is not separate from the problem

The man who most vividly realizes a difficulty is the man most likely to overcome it

A good problem statement often includes a what is known b what is unknown and c what is sought

Every path has its puddle

You often get a better hold upon a problem by going away from it for a time and dismissing it from your mind altogether

What one decides to do in crisis depends on ones philosophy of life and that philosophy cannot be changed by an incident If one hasnt any philosophy in crises others make the decision

When I feel difficulty coming on I switch to another book Im writing When I get back to the problem my unconscious has solved it

You can surmount the obstacles in your path if you are determined courageous and hardworking Never be fainthearted Be resolute but never bitter Permit no one to dissuade you from pursuing the goals you set for yourselves Do not fear to pioneer to venture down new paths of endeavor

Any concern too small to be turned into a prayer is too small to be made into a burden

When you approach a problem strip yourself of preconceived opinions and prejudice assemble and learn the facts of the situation make the decision which seems to you to be the most honest and then stick to it

The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them

No matter how big and tough a problem may be get rid of confusion by taking one little step towards solution Do something Then try again At the worst so long as you dont do it the same way twice you will eventually use up all the wrong ways of doing it and thus the next try will be the right one

The greatest and most important problems of life are all in a certain sense insoluble They can never be solved but only outgrown

You can overcome anything if you dont bellyache

There is no other solution to a mans problems but the days honest work the days honest decisions the days generous utterance and the days good deed

Every problem contains the seeds of its own solution

When you cant solve the problem manage it

The block of granite which was an obstacle in the path of the weak becomes a stepping stone in the path of the strong

Real difficulties can be overcome it is only the imaginary ones that are unconquerable

Many a man curses the rain that falls upon his head and knows not that it brings abundance to drive away hunger

Times of general calamity and confusion have ever been productive of the greatest minds The purest ore is produced from the hottest furnace and the brightest thunderbolt is elicited from the darkest storms

What is difficulty Only a word indicating the degree of strength requisite for accomplishing particular objects a mere notice of the necessity for exertion a mere stimulus to men

Problems are only opportunities in work clothes

We must look for the opportunity in every difficulty instead of being paralyzed at the thought of the difficulty in every opportunity

Half the unhappiness in life comes from people being afraid to go straight at things

All work of man is as the swimmers a vast ocean threatens to devour him if he front it not bravely it will keep its word

Hiding leads nowhere except to more hiding

There is no movement without our own resistance

All problems become smaller if you dont dodge them but confront them

The best way out of a problem is through it

A great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism and spends his energies upon that

Fear not those who argue but those who dodge

If the first woman God ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down these women together ought to be able to turn it right side up again

It is a fact of history that those who seek to withdraw from its great experiments usually end up being overwhelmed by them

Only one feat is possible not to have run away

We only really face up to ourselves when we are afraid

Life is the acceptance of responsibilities or their evasion it is a business of meeting obligations or avoiding them To every man the choice is continually being offered and by the manner of his choosing you may fairly measure him

The superior man makes the difficulty to be overcome his first interest success comes only later

No man will succeed unless he is ready to face and overcome difficulties and is prepared to assume responsibilities

The harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph What we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly tis dearness only that gives everything its value

The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it

Life affords no higher pleasure than that of surmounting difficulties

Can it be that man is essentially a being who loves to conquer difficulties a creature whose function is to solve problems

Conquering any difficulty always gives one a secret joy for it means pushing back a boundaryline and adding to ones liberty

To overcome difficulties is to experience the full delight of existence

Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles he has overcome trying to succeed

Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal

Difficulties exist to be surmounted

The man with insight enough to admit his limitations comes nearest to perfection

The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking ones work seriously and taking ones self seriously The first is imperative and the second is disastrous

Growth begins when we start to accept our own weakness

To dream of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are

Of all the young men in America only a few hundred can get into major league baseball and of these only a handful in a decade can get into the Hall of Fame So it goes in all human activity Some become multimillionaires and chairmen of the board and some of us must be content to play baseball at company picnics or manage a credit union without pay

At thirty a man should know himself like the palm of his hand know the exact number of his defects and qualities And above all accept these things

No man can climb out beyond the limitations of his own character

You cant make the Duchess of Windsor into Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm The facts of life are very stubborn things

Sometimes it is more important to discover what one cannot do than what one can do

Learn to be what you are and learn to resign with a good grace all that you are not

We cannot all be masters

To do all that one is able to do is to be a man to do all that one would like to do is to be a god

No one is expected to achieve the impossible

A hero is a man who does what he can

It is only fools who keep straining at high C all their lives

May God let me strive for attainable things

Despair is the price one pays for setting himself an impossible aim

We would have to settle for the elegant goal of becoming ourselves

A great obstacle to happiness is to expect too much happiness

There is a proper balance between not asking enough of oneself and asking or expecting too much

I hope to work support my children and die quietly without pain

As we advance in life we learn the limits of our abilities

Striving for excellence motivates you striving for perfection is demoralizing

It is enough that I am of value to somebody today

A tomb now suffices him for whom the whole world was not sufficient

To wish to act like angels while we are still in this world is nothing but folly

It isnt important to come out on top what matters is to be the one who comes out alive

I long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish small tasks as if they were great and noble

I cannot do everything but still I can do something and because I cannot do everything I will not refuse to do something I can do

Do not lose courage in considering your own imperfections

Happy the man who early learns the wide chasm that lies between his wishes and his powers

Being a parent is tough If you just want a wonderful little creature to love you can get a puppy

You never conquer a mountain You stand on the summit a few moments then the wind blows your footprints away

If we are to survive on this planet there must be compromises

Real life is to most men a perpetual compromise between the ideal and the possible

He who cannot do what he wants must make do with what he can

What has always made a hell on earth has been that man has tried to make it his heaven

Good is not good where better is expected

Nobody has things just as he would like them The thing to do is to make a success with what material I have It is a sheer waste of time and soulpower to imagine what I would do if things were different They are not different

People are lucky and unlucky according to the ratio between what they get and what they have been led to expect

We must like what we have when we dont have what we like

Better is the enemy of the good

If you aspire to the highest place it is no disgrace to stop at the second or even the third place

Genius does what it must talent does what it can

A hero is a man who does what he can

Nature is what you may do There is much you may not do

Results are what you expect consequences are what you get

The resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering

To expect life to be tailored to our specifications is to invite frustration

Each of us does in effect strike a series of deals or compromises between the wants and longings of the inner self and an outer environment that offers certain possibilities and sets certain limitations

Man is the only animal that laughs and weeps for he is the only animal that is struck with the difference between what things are and what they might have been

We do not write as we want but as we can

Every creator painfully experiences the chasm between his inner vision and its ultimate expression The chasm is never completely bridged We all have the conviction perhaps illusory that we have much more to say than appears on the paper

A body shouldnt heed what might be Hes got to do with what is

The chief pang of most trials is not so much the actual suffering itself as our own spirit of resistance to it

The greatest and most important problems in life are all in a certain sense insoluble They can never be solved but only outgrown

The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them

Life has not taught me to expect nothing but she has taught me not to expect success to be the inevitable result of my endeavors

Knowledge of what is possible is the beginning of happiness

Dont spend time beating on a wall hoping to transform it into a door

If I were to wish for anything I should not wish for wealth and power but for the passionate sense of the potential for the eye which ever young and ardent sees the possible what wine is so sparkling so fragrant so intoxicating as possibility

Wisdom never kicks at the iron walls it cant bring down

It is impossible to control creation

To seek fulfillment is to invite frustration

Half the unhappiness in the world is due to the failure of plans which were never reasonable and often impossible

There is an illusion that has much to do with most of our unhappiness We expect too much

A fool or idiot is one who expects things to happen that never can happen

Shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of pygmies and not be the biggest pygmy that he can

Life is a compromise of what your ego wants to do what experience tells you to do and what your nerves let you do

No Doctor I dont want to grow young again I just want to keep on growing old

What we call reality is an agreement that people have arrived at to make life more livable

There is no such thing as pure pleasure some anxiety always goes with it

When somebody tells you nothing is impossible ask him to dribble a football

No country can act wisely simultaneously in every part of the globe at every moment of time

The most important thing in marriage is not happiness but stability

So often we search out the impossible and then throw ourselves into trying to do it

Nothing is so good as it seems beforehand

Prospect is often better than possession

The hours we pass with happy prospects in view are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition

Tis expectation makes a blessing dear heaven were not heaven if we knew what it were

Life is so constructed that the event does not cannot will not match the expectation

There is no greater enemy to those who would please than expectation

To dream too much of the person you would like to be is to waste the person you are

Too many people miss the silver lining because theyre expecting gold

For people who live on expectations to face up to their realization is something of an ordeal

My expectationswhich I extended whenever I came close to accomplishing my goalsmade it impossible ever to feel satisfied with my success

Every attempt to make war easy and safe will result in humiliation and disaster

I sincerely wish war was a pleasanter and easier business than it is but it does not admit of holidays

There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but boys it is all hell

War is not an adventure It is a disease It is like typhus

In combat life is short nasty and brutish The issues of national policy which brought him into war are irrelevant to the combat soldier he is concerned with his literal life chances

In war more than anywhere else in the world things happen differently from what we had expected and look differently when near from what they did at a distance

In spite of all of the training you get and the precautions you take to keep yourself alive its largely a matter of luck that decides whether or not you get killed

Moderation in war is imbecility

When ones expectations are reduced to zero one really appreciates everything one does have

I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way they have to live than other things do

Life didnt promise to be wonderful

We never enjoy perfect happiness our most fortunate successes are mingled with sadness some anxieties always perplex the reality of our satisfaction

Do not commit the error common among the young of assuming that if you cannot save the whole of mankind you have failed

The art of living lies less in eliminating our troubles than in growing with them

If one considered life as a simple loan one would perhaps be less exacting

Why are we surprised when fig trees bear figs

Those who aim at great deeds must also suffer greatly

I have nothing to offer but blood toil tears and sweat

Theres no map theres no master plan theres just people

Every writer I know has trouble writing

Men expect too much do too little

Human kind cannot bear very much reality

If anything is poisoning our lives and weakening our society it is reality and not the fabrication of television writers and producers

There is no reality except the one contained within us That is why so many people live such an unreal life They take the images outside them for reality and never allow the world within to assert itself

Nothing which is at all times and in every way agreeable to us can have objective reality It is of the very nature of the real that it should have sharp corners and rough edges that it should be resistant should be itself Dreamfurniture is the only kind on which you never stub your toes or bang your knee

Facts as facts do not always create a spirit of reality because reality is a spirit

We take our shape it is true within and against that cage of reality bequeathed us at our birth and yet it is precisely through our dependence on this reality that we are most endlessly betrayed

You too must not count overmuch on your reality as you feel it today since like that of yesterday it may prove an illusion for you tomorrow

All our interior world is reality and that perhaps more so than our apparent world

The field of consciousness is tiny It accepts only one problem at a time Get into a fist fight put your mind on the strategy of the fight and you will not feel the other fellows punches

A life based on reason will always require to be balanced by an occasional bout of violent and irrational emotion for the instinctual tribes must be satisfied

Analysis kills spontaneity The grain once ground into flour springs and germinates no more

Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored

I like reality It tastes of bread

The time is comin whin not more thin hath iv usll be rale an th restll be rubber plastic

To see what is in front of ones nose needs a constant struggle

We do not fight for the real but for shadows we make A flag is a piece of cloth and a word is a sound But we make them something neither cloth nor a sound Tokens of love and hate black sorcery stones

Where I cannot satisfy my reason I love to humour my fancy

When the human mind exists in the light of reason and no more than reason we may say with absolute certainty that Man and all that made him will be in that instant gone

I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning

Reason is Gods gift but so are the passions Reason is as guilty as passion

The man who is master of his passions is Reasons slave

Human reason needs only to will more strongly than fate and she is fate

Reason deserves to be called a prophet for in showing up the consequence and effect of our actions in the present does it not tell us what the future will be

The difference between the reason of man and the instinct of the beast is this that the beast does but know but the man knows that he knows

Reason is also choice

Reason is an emotion for the sexless

The last advance of reason is to recognize that it is surpassed by innumerable things it is feeble if it cannot realize that

All our reasoning ends in surrender to feeling

Reason is the mistress and queen of all things

He who will not reason is a bigot he who cannot is a fool and he who dares not is a slave

Reason can in general do more than blind force

If I go to heaven I want to take my reason with me

Come now and let us reason together

Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it

Human reason is like a drunken man on horseback set it up on one side and it tumbles over on the other

You know my friends with what a brave carouse I made a second marriage in my house Divorced old barren reason from my bed And took the daughter of the vine to spouse

The feast of reason and the flow of soul

Every why hath a wherefore

I have no other but a womans reason I think him so because I think him so

Many are destined to reason wrongly others not to reason at all and others to persecute those who do reason

There are so many people with all kinds of lucky things happening to them and they dont know how to use it

Probably any successful career has X number of breaks in it and maybe the difference between successful people and those who arent superachievers is taking advantage of those breaks

To get it right be born with luck or else make it

You must always be open to your luck You cannot force it but you can recognize it

Genius is the gold in the mine talent is the miner that works and brings it out

It is one thing to be gifted and quite another thing to be worthy of ones own gift

Talent on its own sat gracefully only on the very young After a certain age it was what you did with it that counted

A wise man turns chance into good fortune

Luck taps once in a lifetime at everybodys door but if industry does not open it luck goes away

When something bad happens to me I think Im able to deal with it in a pretty good way That makes me lucky Some people fall apart at the first little thing that happens

Its funny but youre sort of a moving target for fortune and you never know when it will befall you

Lady Luck generally woos those who earnestly enthusiastically unremittingly woo her

Luck is good planning carefully executed

What helps luck is a habit of watching for opportunities of having a patient but restless mind of sacrificing ones ease or vanity of uniting a love of detail to foresight and of passing through hard times bravely and cheerfully

Luck is believing youre lucky

I think that one can have luck if one tries to create an atmosphere of spontaneity

Each mans character shapes his fortunes

Chance works for us when we are good captains

Motivation triggers luck

Good and bad luck is a synonym in the great majority of instances for good and bad judgment

Luck is a combination of confidence and getting the breaks

I was born lucky and I have lived lucky What I had was used What I still have is being used Lucky

Luck is largely a matter of paying attention

Your luck is how you treat people

The only sure thing about luck is that it will change

The man who glories in his luck may be overthrown by destiny

There is in the worst of fortune the best of chances for a happy change

It is more easy to get a favor from fortune than to keep it

Since lucks a nine days wonder wait their end

Fortune is with you for an hour and against you for ten

Breaks balance out The sun dont shine on the same old dogs rear end every day

What the reason of the ant laboriously drags into a heap the wind of accident will collect in one breath

Fortune is like the market where many times if you can stay a little the price will fall

The profits of good luck are perishable if you build on fortune you build on sand the more advancement you achieve the more dangers you run

Every possession and every happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time and may therefore be demanded back the next hour

Life is full of chances and changes and the most prosperous of men may meet with great misfortunes

Reforms should begin at home and stay there

At twenty a man is full of fight and hope He wants to reform the world When hes seventy he still wants to reform the world but he knows he cant

We are reformers in Spring and Summer in Autumn and Winter we stand by the old reformers in the morning conservers at night

Reform must come from within not from without You cannot legislate for virtue

The hole and the patch should be commensurate

To make a crooked stick straight we bend it the contrary way

An indefinable something is to be done in a way nobody knows how at a time nobody knows when that will accomplish nobody knows what

Very frequently feminine activity also expresses itself in what is largely a retrospectively oriented pondering over what we ought to have done differently in life and how we ought to have done it or as if under compulsion we make up strings of causal connections We like to call this thinking though on the contrary it is a form of mental activity that is strangely pointless and unproductive a form that really leads only to selftorture

The only causes of regret are laziness outbursts of temper hurting others prejudice jealousy and envy

If you have behaved badly repent make what amends you can and address yourself to the task of behaving better next time On no account brood over your wrongdoing Rolling in the muck is not the best way of getting clean

You always feel when you look it straight in the eye that you could have put more into it could have let yourself go and dug harder

When one door closes another opens But we often look so long and so regretfully upon the closed door that we fail to see the one that has opened for us

No doing without some ruing

Nobody gets to live life backward Look ahead that is where your future lies

Were it not better to forget Than to remember and regret

Regret for the things we did can be tempered by time it is regret for the things we did not do that is inconsolable

Always repenting of wrongs done will never bring my heart to rest

Shouldhaves solve nothing Its the next thing to happen that needs thinking about

The error of the past is the success of the future A mistake is evidence that someone tried to do something

Regret is an appalling waste of energy you cant build on it it is good only for wallowing

I have always found that each step we take in life is to be regrettedif we once begin to wonder how many other steps might have been possible

If you cannot get rid of the family skeleton you may as well make it dance

Let the dead Past bury its dead

The horror of that moment the King went on I shall never forget You will though the Queen said if you dont make a memorandum of it

Reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has manynot on your past misfortunes of which all men have some

They say you should not suffer through the past You should be able to wear it like a loose garment take it off and let it drop

Your past is always going to be the way it was Stop trying to change it

The only thing I regret about my past is the length of it If I had to live my life again Id make the same mistakes only sooner

There is no greater sorrow than to recall a happy time in the midst of wretchedness

We should have no regrets The past is finished There is nothing to be gained by going over it Whatever it gave us in the experiences it brought us was something we had to know

One must never lose time in vainly regretting the past or in complaining against the changes which cause us discomfort for change is the essence of life

Yesterdays errors let yesterday cover

This is another day Are its eyes blurred with maudlin grief for any wasted past A thousand thousand failures shall not daunt Let dust clasp dust death death I am alive

Whatever with the past has gone the best is always yet to come

Hindsight is always zo20

I respect only those who resist me but cannot tolerate them

The easiest kind of relationship for me is with 10000 people The hardest is with one

When the man is at home his standing in society is well known and quietly taken but when he is abroad it is problematical and is dependent on the success of his manners

We rarely confide in those who are better than we are

With three or more people there is something bold in the air direct things get said which would frighten two people alone and conscious of each inch of their nearness to one another To be three is to be in public you feel safe

It is always safe to assume that people are more subtle and less sensitive than they seem

The more you let yourself go the less others let you go

At bottom the world isnt a joke We only joke about it to avoid an issue with someone to let someone know that we know hes there with his questions to disarm him by seeming to have heard and done justice to his side of the standing argument

Science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all the apathy of human beings

It is well to remember that the entire population of the universe with one trifling exception is composed of others

Make yourself necessary to somebody

The opinions which we hold of one another our relations with friends and kinsfolk are in no sense permanent save in appearance but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself

I present myself to you in a form suitable to the relationship I wish to achieve with you

The ultimate indignity is to be given a bedpan by a stranger who calls you by your first name

And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts His sisters and his cousins Whom he reckons up by dozens And his aunts

No man will be respected by others who is despised by his own relatives

The worst hatred is that of relatives

Ones religion is whatever he is most interested in

Religion is the way we honour our ancestors errors

The church exists for the sake of those outside it

The writers against religion whilst they oppose every system are wisely careful never to set up any of their own

The idea that He would take his attention away from the universe in order to give me a bicycle with three speeds is just so unlikely I cant go along with it

The Pope is barely Catholic enough for some converts

The test for a prophet is in the Bible It is this When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken

The three great apostles of practical atheism that make converts without persecuting and retain them without preaching are Wealth Health and Power

To tolerate everything is to teach nothing

We are a rather bigheaded little species in a vast cosmos which can do without us very well

When people cease to believe in God they dont believe in nothing they believe in anything

Zen is a way of liberation concerned not with discovering what is good or bad or advantageous but what is

The merit claimed for the Anglican Church is that if you let it alone it will let you alone

Mystic a person who is puzzled before the obvious but who understands the nonexistent

Faith means intense usually confident belief that is not based on evidence sufficient to command assent from every reasonable person

Men will wrangle for religion write for it fight for it die for it anything but live for it

I have never yet met a healthy person who worries very much about his health or a really good person who worries much about his own soul

Men are idolaters and want something to look at and kiss and hug or throw themselves down before they always did they always will and if you dont make it of wood you must make it of words

Success based on anything but internal fulfillment is bound to be empty

Every true man sir who is a little above the level of the beasts and plants lives so as to give a meaning and a value to his own life

Sir I would rather be right than be President

He will hew to the line of right let the chips fly where they may

Be sure you are right then go ahead

Two wrongs can never make a right

Let us have faith that Right makes Might and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it

Right is the eternal sun the world cannot delay its coming

One truth is clear Whatever is is right

Heaven itself has ordained the right

Wherever there is a human being I see Godgiven rights inherent in that being whatever may be the sex or complexion

The equal right of all men to the use of land is as clear as their equal right to breathe the air it is a right proclaimed by the fact of their existence For we cannot suppose that some men have a right to be in this world and others no right

Equal rights for all special privileges for none

You risk just as much in being credulous as in being suspicious

Our whole way of life today is dedicated to the removal of risk Cradle to grave we are supported insulated and isolated from the risks of life and if we fall our government stands ready with BandAids of every size

Any life truly lived is a risky business and if one puts up too many fences against the risks one ends by shutting out life itself

However well organized the foundations of life may be life must always be full of risks

Dancing on the edge is the only place to be

It is so tempting to try the most difficult thing possible

Do not be too timid and squeamish All life is an experiment The more experiments you make the better

All life is a chance So take it The person who goes furthest is the one who is willing to do and dare

I postpone death by living by suffering by error by risking by giving by losing

We love because it is the only true adventure

If your life is ever going to get better youll have to take risks There is simply no way you can grow without taking chances

Youve got to keep fightingyouve got to risk your life every six months to stay alive

It takes courage to lead a life Any life

Theres no such thing as a sure thing Thats why they call it gambling

It is only by risking that we live at all

Life is a risk

To be alive at all involves some risk

This nation was built by men who took riskspioneers who were not afraid of the wilderness business men who were not afraid of failure scientists who were not afraid of the truth thinkers who were not afraid of progress dreamers who were not afraid of action

To live without risk for me would be tantamount to death

It is the business of the future to be dangerous

To achieve anything you must be prepared to dabble on the boundary of disaster

He that will not sail till all dangers are over must never put to sea

The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore

If we are intended for great ends we are called to great hazards

Liberty is always dangerous but it is the safest thing we have

As soon as there is life there is danger

One never finds anything perfectly pure and exempt from danger

He that is not in the war is not out of danger

Danger itself is the best remedy for danger

A sharp knife cuts the quickest and hurts the least

Its only when we have nothing else to hold onto that were willing to try something very audacious and scary

Without danger we cannot get beyond danger

Constant exposure to dangers will breed contempt for them

Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure The fearful are caught as often as the bold

All reformations seem formidable before they are attempted

What one has not experienced one will never understand in print

Doing is a quantum leap from imagining

It is not manly to turn ones back on fortune

Be bold and mighty forces will come to your aid

A leader must face danger He must take the risk and the blame and the brunt of the storm

Fortune and love befriend the bold

Our safety is not in blindness but in facing our danger

Of course people are afraid But honestly facing that fear seeing it for what it is is the only way of putting it to rest

Unless you enter the tigers den you cannot take the cubs

All work of man is as the swimmers a vast ocean threatens to devour him if he front it not bravely it will keep its word

They are surely to be esteemed the bravest spirits who having the clearest sense of both the pains and pleasures of life do not on that account shrink from danger

If one is forever cautious can one remain a human being

An individual dies when instead of taking risks and hurling himself toward being he cowers within and takes refuge there

Few are they who have never had a chance to achieve happinessand fewer those who have taken that chance

You have all eternity to be cautious in when youre dead

Without risk faith is an impossibility

Who dares nothing need hope for nothing

If youre never scared or embarrassed or hurt it means you never take any chances

It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare it is because we do not dare that they are difficult

Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go

In order to find the edge you must risk going over the edge

Make voyages Attempt them Theres nothing else

The faster you go the more chance there is of stubbing your toe but the more chance you have of getting somewhere

Taking risks gives me energy

The torment of precautions often exceeds the dangers to be avoided It is sometimes better to abandon ones self to destiny

What is necessary is never a risk

To render ourselves insensible to pain we must forfeit also the possibilities of happiness

Take risks if you win you will be happy if you lose you will be wise

Women must think strategically about creating ongoing pressure for change

Anything Ive ever done that ultimately was worthwhile initially scared me to death

Attempt the impossible in order to improve your work

When you make a commitment to a relationship you invest your attention and energy in it more profoundly because you now experience ownership of that relationship

The men who have done big things are those who were not afraid to attempt big things who were not afraid to risk failure in order to gain success

Security is not the meaning of my life Great opportunities are worth the risks

Ill always push the envelope To me the ultimate sin in life is to be boring I dont play it safe

If the riskreward ratio is right you can make big money buying trouble

What isnt tried wont work

It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees

Security is mostly superstition It does not exist in nature

All great reforms require one to dare a lot to win a little

Competition can damage selfesteem create anxiety and lead to cheating and hurt feelings But so can romantic love

I am willing to put myself through anything temporary pain or discomfort means nothing to me as long as I can see that the experience will take me to a new level I am interested in the unknown and the only path to the unknown is through breaking barriers an often painful process

If you limit your actions in life to things that nobody can possibly find fault with you will not do much

Those lose least who have least to lose

The ambitious climb high and perilous stairs and never care how to come down the desire of rising hath swallowed up their fear of a fall

He that would have fruit must climb the tree

Love like a chicken salad or restaurant hash must be taken with blind faith or it loses its flavor

Every noble acquisition is attended with its risks he who fears to encounter the one must not expect to obtain the other

Providence has hidden a charm in difficult undertakings which is appreciated only by those who dare to grapple with them

To get profit without risk experience without danger and reward without work is as impossible as it is to live without being born

The method of the enterprising is to plan with audacity and execute with vigor

Great deeds are usually wrought at great risks

Life is a risk

Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly

He that is overcautious will accomplish little

No one reaches a high position without daring

Cadillacs are down at the end of the bat

It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks

You cant expect to hit the jackpot if you dont put a few nickels in the machine

Who dares nothing need hope for nothing

Progress always involves risks You cant steal second base and keep your foot on first

You cant catch trout with dry breeches

I dont think about risks much I just do what I want to do If you gotta go you gotta go

Behold the turtle He makes progress only when he sticks his neck out

Nothing ventured nothing gained

Dont be afraid to take a big step if one is indicated You cant cross a chasm in two small steps

There is little place in the political scheme of things for an independent creative personality for a fighter Anyone who takes that role must pay a price

Take calculated risks That is quite different from being rash

Valour lies just halfway between rashness and cowardice

I compensate for big risks by always doing my homework and being wellprepared I can take on larger risks by reducing the overall risk

Accept that all of us can be hurt that all of us canand surely will at timesfail Other vulnerabilities like being embarrassed or risking love can be terrifying too I think we should follow a simple rule if we can take the worst take the risk

Every man has the right to risk his own life in order to preserve it Has it ever been said that a man who throws himself out the window to escape a fire is guilty of suicide

Courage is rarely reckless or foolish courage usually involves a highly realistic estimate of the odds that must be faced

You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake

It is the risk element which ensures security Risk brings out the ingenuity and resourcefulness which ensure success

Entrepreneurs in accepting risk achieve security for all In embracing change they ensure social and economic stability

Those who cling to life die and those who defy death live

And the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more

Danger can never by overcome without taking risks

The rewards go to the risktakers those who are willing to put their egos on the line and reach out to other people and to a richer fuller life for themselves

Every minute of life I take a risk its part of the enjoyment

Everything is sweetened by risk

My favorite thing is to go where I have never gone

The power of habit and the charm of novelty are the two adverse forces which explain the follies of mankind

The soul should always stand ajar ready to welcome the ecstatic experience

Adventure is worthwhile in itself

We may by our excessive prudence squeeze out of the life we are guarding so anxiously all the adventurous quality that makes it worth living

A dreameryou knowits a mind that looks over the edges of things

I feel very adventurous There are so many doors to be opened and Im not afraid to look behind them

Danger and delight grow on one stalk

Life has no romance without risk

The moment somebody says this is very risky is the moment it becomes attractive to me

One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar

Prudence keeps life safe but does not often make it happy

Between two evils I always picked the one I never tried before

Life is either always a tightrope or a feather bed Give me the tightrope

The greater the difficulty the more glory in surmounting it

Victories that are cheap are cheap Those only are worth having which come as the result of hard fighting

The greater the obstacle the more glory in overcoming it

People who are born eventempered placid and untroubledsecure from violent passions or temptations to evilthose who have never needed to struggle all night with the angel to emerge lame but victorious at dawn never become great saints

The harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph What we obtain too cheaply we esteem too lightly tis dearness only that gives everything its value

The fiery trials through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the last generation

To conquer without risk is to triumph without glory

There could be no honor in a sure success but much might be wrested from a sure defeat

The follies which a man regrets most in his life are those which he didnt commit when he had the opportunity

There is no memory with less satisfaction than the memory of some temptation we resisted

The only things one never regrets are ones mistakes

The only things you regret are the things you dont do

The defense force inside of us wants us to be cautious to stay away from anything as intense as a new kind of action Its job is to protect us and it categorically avoids anything resembling danger But its often wrong

For of all sad words of tongues or pen the saddest are these It might have been

Calculation never made a hero

To play it safe is not to play

Better hazard once than always be in fear

No one would have crossed the ocean if he could have gotten off the ship in the storm

Nine times out of ten the best thing that can happen to a young man is to be tossed overboard and compelled to sink or swim

Life is either a daring adventure or nothing

When something does not insist on being noticed when we arent grabbed by the collar or struck on the skull by a presence or an event we take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude

There are those who have discovered that fear is death in life and have willingly risked physical death and loss of all that is considered valuable in order to live in freedom

I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for truth and truth rewarded me

In danger there is great power

Why not go out on a limb Isnt that where the fruit is

You might as well fall flat on your face as lean over too far backward

Defensive strategy never has produced ultimate victory

We stand now where two roads diverge But unlike the roads in Robert Frosts familiar poem they are not equally fair The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed but at its end lies disaster The other fork of the roadthe one less traveled byoffers our last our only chance to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the earth

To gain that which is worth having it may be necessary to lose everything else

We fail far more often by timidity than by overdaring

Nothing can resist a will which will stake even existence upon its fulfillment

Risk always brings its own rewards the exhilaration of breaking through of getting to the other side the relief of a conflict healed the clarity when a paradox dissolves

No guts no glory

Sometimes I think we can tell how important it is to risk by how dangerous it is to do so

Living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building your wings on the way down

We owe something to extravagance for thrift and adventure seldom go hand in hand

I prefer liberty with danger to peace with slavery

Do not follow where the path may lead Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail

Be wary of the man who urges an action in which he himself incurs no risk

Creativity is inventing experimenting growing taking risks breaking rules making mistakes and having fun

Necessity is the mother of taking chances

I am one of those people who cant help getting a kick out of lifeeven when its a kick in the teeth

Something must be left to chance nothing is sure in a sea fight beyond all others

You do not have to be superhuman to do what you believe in

We can only do what is possible for us to do But still it is good to know what the impossible is

I love the challenge

We must dare and dare again and go on daring

Into the darkness they go the wise and the lovely

Dare to be naive

My playground was the theatre Id sit and watch my mother pretend for a living As a young girl thats pretty seductive

What you teach your own children is what you really believe in

Nothing arouses ambition so much as the trumpet clang of anothers fame

I studied the lives of great men and famous women and I found that the men and women who got to the top were those who did the jobs they had in hand with everything they had of energy and enthusiasm and hard work

I believe in recovery and I believe that as a role model I have the responsibility to let young people know that you can make a mistake and come back from it

People never improve unless they look to some standard or example higher and better than themselves

My heart is happy my mind is free I had a father who talked with me

If a child is too keep alive his inborn sense of wonder he needs the companionship of at least one adult who can share it rediscovering with him the joy excitement and mystery of the world we live in

Examine the personality of the mother who is the medium through which the primitive infant transforms herself into a socialized human being

That some should be rich shows that others may become rich and hence is just encouragement to industry and enterprise

The best teachers of humanity are the lives of great men

As it is our nature to be more moved by hope than fear the example of one we see abundantly rewarded cheers and encourages us far more than the sight of many who have not been well treated disquiets us

Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions Small people always do that but the really great make you feel that you too can become great

To be ignorant of the lives of the most celebrated men of antiquity is to continue in a state of childhood

People seldom improve when they have no other model but themselves to copy

As you get older it is harder to have heroes but it is sort of necessary

The most important single influence in the life of a person is another person who is worthy of emulation

Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time

Very few men are wise by their own counsel or learned by their own teaching For he that was only taught by himself had a fool for his master

Call the roll in your memory of conspicuously successful business giants and you will be struck by the fact that almost every one of them encountered inordinate difficulties sufficient to crush all but the gamest of spirits Edison went hungry many times before he became famous

Without heroes we are all plain people and dont know how far we can go

If you cant be a good example then youll just have to be a horrible warning

A good example is the best sermon

Children have more need of models than of critics

Kill reverence and youve killed the hero in man

We deceive ourselves when we fancy that only weakness needs support Strength needs it far more

Example has more followers than reason

Example moves the world more than doctrine

Example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other

Example is not the main thing in influencing others It is the only thing

We travel to learn and I have never been in any country where they did not do something better than we do it think some thoughts better than we think catch some inspiration from heights above our own

Judgment can be acquired only by acute observation by actual experience in the school of life by ceaseless alertness to learn from others by study of the activities of men who have made notable marks by striving to analyze the everyday play of causes and effects by constant study of human nature

We need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives

When you are a mother you are never really alone in your thoughts A mother has to think twice once for herself and once for her child

Our mothers and our grandmothers some of them moving to music not yet written

Nothing is so infectious as example

There is a need for heroism in American life today

One filled with joy preaches without preaching

There is a difference between imitating a good man and counterfeiting him

Imitation is for shirkers likemindedness for the comfort lovers unifying for the creators

Each of us is in fact what he is almost exclusively by virtue of his imitativeness

Go to the ant thou sluggard learn to live and by her busy ways reform thy own

Imitation is a necessity of human nature

When people are free to do as they please they usually imitate each other

Whatever good I have accomplished as an actress I believe came in direct proportion to my efforts to portray black women who have made positive contributions to my heritage

Emulation is a noble and just passion full of appreciation

Emulation admires and strives to imitate great actions envy is only moved to malice

Imitation can acquire pretty much everything but the power which created the thing imitated

Almost all absurdity of conduct arises from the imitation of those whom we cannot resemble

To do exactly as your neighbors do is the only sensible rule

From the errors of others a wise man corrects his own

Learn from the mistakes of others you cant live long enough to make them all yourself

Wise men learn by other mens mistakes fools by their own

All roads lead to Rome but our antagonists think we should choose different paths

The grandeur that was Rome

Rome was not built in a day

The king reigns but does not govern

That the king can do no wrong is a necessary and fundamental principle of the English constitution

Every noble crown is and on Earth will forever be a crown of thorns

The trappings of a monarchy would set up an ordinary commonwealth

I am the State

The King is dead Long live the King

Put not your trust in princes

Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown

Ay every inch a king

Nations have passed away and left no traces And history gives the naked cause of it One single simple reason in all cases They fell because their peoples were not fit

So in the Libyan fable it is told That once an eagle stricken with a dart Said when he saw the fashion of the shaft With our own feathers not by others hands Are we now smitten

No man is demolished but by himself

What does not destroy me makes me strong

I never was ruined but twice once when I lost a lawsuit and once when I gained one

All men that are ruined are ruined on the side of their natural propensities

My downfall raises me to infinite heights

Candour and generosity unless tempered by due moderation lead to ruin

Italians come to ruin most generally in three ways women gambling and farming My family chose the slowest one

They say so is half a lie

I cannot tell how the truth may be I say the tale as twas said to me

What some invent the rest enlarge

God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made

Day of the Lord as all our days should be

The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath

What makes old age so sad is not that our joys but our hopes cease

No sadder proof can be given by a man of his own littleness than disbelief in great men

No one is more profoundly sad than he who laughs too much

Nothing is more sad than the death of an illusion

A feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain

Reminiscences make one feel so deliciously aged and sad

Poverty makes you sad as well as wise

Sadness is a state of sin

Sadness and gladness succeed each other

Proud people breed sad sorrows for themselves

It is sad to grow old but nice to ripen

Sadness flies on the wings of the morning and out of the heart of darkness comes the light

Sadness flies away on the wings of time

It is better to be safe than sorry

The trodden path is the safest

They that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the deep

The wind that blows the ship that goes And the lass that loves a sailor

The principle of procrastinated rape is said to be the ruling one in all the great bestsellers

The structure of a play is always the story of how the birds came home to roost

One is healthy when one can laugh at the earnestness and zeal with which one has been hypnotized by any single detail of ones life

When we remember that we are all mad the mysteries disappear and life stands explained

Madness is part of all of us all the time and it comes and goes waxes and wanes

A man should not strive to eliminate his complexes but to get into accord with them they are legitimately what directs his conduct in the world

Work and love these are the basics waking life is a dream controlled

Outside among your fellows among strangers you must preserve appearances a hundred things you cannot do but inside the terrible freedom

Sanity is very rare every man almost and every woman has a dash of madness

Mad bad and dangerous to know

We are all born mad Some remain so

There is a pleasure sure In being mad which none but madmen know

He not only overflowed with learning but stood in the slop

If we wish to know the force of human genius we should read Shakespeare If we wish to see the insignificance of human learning we may study his commentators

The clever men at Oxford Know all there is to be knowed But they none of them know as half as much As intelligent Mr Toad

Research as the college student will come to know it is relatively thorough investigation primarily in libraries of a properly limited topic and presentation of the results of this investigation in a carefully organized and documented paper of some length

A man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumberroom of his library where he can get it if he wants it

What is research but a blind date with knowledge

If I had read as much as other men I should have known no more than they

Deepversed in books And shallow in himself

Learning is the knowledge of that which none but the learned know

I would live to study not study to live

Almost all important questions are important precisely because they are not susceptible to quantitative answer

The schools aint what they used to be and never was

I pay the School Master but tis the school boys that educate my son

Schoolmasters and parents exist to be grown out of

If school results were the key to power girls would be running the world

Example is the school of mankind and they will learn at no other

Failure is a school in which the truth always grows strong

If law school is so hard to get through how come there are so many lawyers

All science is either Physics or stampcollecting

As far as the laws of Mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality

He had read Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry

I am sorry to say there is too much point to the wise crack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours

If all the arts aspire to the condition of music all the sciences aspire to the condition of mathematics

If the human race wants to go to Hell in a basket technology can help it get there by jet

In science all facts no matter how trivial or banal enjoy democratic equality

Life exists in the universe only because the carbon atom possesses certain exceptional properties

Light is the ultimate messenger of the universe

Most science is only high falutin nature studies

My advice is to look out for engineers they begin with sewing machines and end up with the atomic bomb

Never try to walk across a river just because it has an average depth of four feet

Reason observation and experience the Holy Trinity of Science

Science is built of facts the way a house is built of bricks but an accumulation of facts is no more science than a pile of bricks is a house

Science without religion is lame religion without science is blind

Scientific discovery consists in the interpretation for our own convenience of a system of existence which has been made with no eye to our convenience at all

The means by which we live have outdistanced the ends for which we live Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power We have guided missiles and misguided men

The scientific theory I like best is that the rings of Saturn are composed entirely of lost airline luggage

The simplest schoolboy is now familiar with truths for which Archimedes would have sacrificed his life

Wetenschap is wat wetenschappers doen Science is what scientists do

Technology the knack of so arranging the world that we dont have to experience it

The great tragedy of Science the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact

Technology means the systematic application of scientific or other organized knowledge to practical tasks

Whenever science makes a discovery the devil grabs it while the angels are debating the best way to use it

Science cannot stop while ethics catches up and nobody should expect scientists to do all the thinking for the country

Science must constantly be reminded that her purposes are not the only purposes and that the order of uniform causation which she has use for and is therefore right in postulating may be enveloped in a wider order on which she has no claim at all

Science is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our senseexperience correspond to a logically uniform system of thought

Though many have tried no one has ever yet explained away the decisive fact that science which can do so much cannot decide what it ought to do

It may be bizarre but in my opinion science offers a sure path to God and religion

As both the Mercury and Apollo programs have shown our science and technology are so powerful that if an intense effort is made we can do almost anything we want in say ten years provided we are not in conflict with the laws of nature

The new electronic interdependence recreates the world in the image of a global village

Research is the process of going up alleys to see if they are blind

Research is to see what everybody has seen and to think what nobody else has thought

No scientific theory achieves public acceptance until it has been thoroughly discredited

The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts

Computers can figure out all kinds of problems except the things in the world that just dont add up

The World would be a safer place If someone had a plan Before exploring Outer Space To find the Inner Man

No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right a single experiment can prove me wrong

I think and think for months and years Ninetynine times the conclusion is false The hundredth time I am right

There is more than a mere suspicion that the scientist who comes to ask metaphysical questions and turns away from metaphysical answers may be afraid of those answers

In science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world not to the man to whom the idea first occurs

The perfect computer has been developed You just feed in your problems and they never come out again

Electric clocks reveal to you Precisely when your fuses blew

The telephone is the most important single technological resource of later life

E MC2 Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared

Space isnt remote at all Its only an hours drive away if your car could go straight upwards

It is very seldom that the same man knows much of science and about the things that were known before science came

A science which hesitates to forget its founders is lost

Pollution is nothing but resources were not harvesting

Medieval Technology The Middle Ages invented among other things the crank the horse collar eyeglasses the flying buttress the stirrup the windmill the wheelbarrow printing firearms paper the canal lock the compass the rudder the mechanical clock the spinning wheel and the treadle

The best defence against the atom bomb is not to be there when it goes off

A few observations and much reasoning lead to error many observations and a little reasoning to truth

The most important of my discoveries have been suggested to me by my failures

Basic research is when Im doing what I dont know what Im doing

Sit down before fact as a little child be prepared to give up every preconceived notion follow humbly wherever and to whatever abyss nature leads or you shall learn nothing

If I have seen farther it is by standing on the shoulders of giants

It is the theory which decided what can be observed

Art is I science is we

Every great advance in science has issued from a new audacity of imagination

Steam is no stronger now than it was a hundred years ago but it is put to better use

Science and art belong to the whole world and before them vanish the barriers of nationality

Science is simply common sense at its best that is rigidly accurate in observation and merciless to fallacy in logic

Science is nothing but developed perception interpreted intent common sense rounded out and minutely articulated

Science is the systematic classification of experience

Science is nothing but perception

Science is organized knowledge

Give me but one hour of Scotland Let me see it ere I die

O Caledonia stern and wild Meet nurse for a poetic child Land of brown heath and shaggy wood Land of the mountain and the flood Land of my sires what mortal hand Can eer untie the filial band That knits me to thy rugged strand

A glory gilds the sacred page Majestic like the sun It gives a light to every age It gives but borrows none

Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path

We search the world for truth we cull The good the pure the beautiful From all old flower fields of the soul And weary seekers of the best We come back laden from our quest To find that all the sages said Is in the Book our mothers read

Madam de Stael pronounced architecture to be frozen music so is statuary crystalized spirituality

Then marble softend into life grew warm

Praise the sea on shore remain

He that will learn to pray let him go to sea

I must go down to the seas again to the lonely sea and the sky And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by

The sea hath no king but God alone

Break break break On thy cold gray stones O sea And I would that my tongue could utter The thoughts that arise in me

Autumn to winter winter into spring Spring into summer summer into fall So rolls the changing year and so we change Motion so swift we know not that we move

Spring is a virgin Summer a mother Autumn a widow and Winter a stepmother

There is a skeleton in every house

A man can hide all things excepting twain That he is drunk and that he is in love

The secret things belong unto the Lord our God

Nothing is secret which shall not be made manifest

If you would wish another to keep your secret first keep it yourself

What is told in the ear of a man is often heard 100 miles away

Two things a man cannot hide that he is drunk and that he is in love

Nothing is so burdensome as a secret

It is a secret in the Oxford sense You may tell it to only one person at a time

I know thats a secret for its whispered everywhere

All the knowledge I possess everyone else can acquire but my heart is all my own

Shy and unready men are great betrayers of secrets for there are few wants more urgent for the moment than the want of something to say

In the mind and nature of a man a secret is an ugly thing like a hidden physical defect

Be secret and exult Because of all things known That is most difficult

If you wish to preserve your secret wrap it up in frankness

Where secrecy reigns carelessness and ignorance delight to hide skill loves the light

Whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops

Even in your thought do not curse the king nor in your bedchamber curse the rich for a bird of the air will carry your voice or some winged creature tell the matter

Security is mostly superstition It does not exist in nature Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure The fearful are caught as often as the bold

Security is a false god begin making sacrifices to it and you are lost

God Himself is not secure having given man dominion over His works

The man who looks for security even in the mind is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble

Never think youve seen the last of anything

If you want total security go to prison There youre fed clothed given medical care and so on The only thing lacking is freedom

Life is not orderly No matter how we try to make life so right in the middle of it we die lose a leg fall in love drop a jar of applesauce

Truly nothing is to be expected but the unexpected

Happiness greatness pridenothing is secure nothing keeps

There is no security no assurance that because we wrote something good two months ago we will do it again Actually every time we begin we wonder how we ever did it before

There is no security on this earth Only opportunity

There is no way to take the danger out of human relationships

It is the risk element which ensures security Risk brings out the ingenuity and resourcefulness which insure success

The way to be safe is never to be secure

We are never more in danger than when we think ourselves most secure nor in reality more secure than when we seem to be most in danger

It is when we all play safe that we create a world of utmost insecurity

To keep oneself safe does not mean to bury oneself

Safety first has been the motto of the human race for half a million years but it has never been the motto of leaders

If money is your hope for independence you will never have it The only real security that a man can have in this world is a reserve of knowledge experience and ability

Our greatest illusion is reliance upon the security and permanence of material possessions We must search for some other coin

The only peace the only security is in fulfillment

Solvency is entirely a matter of temperament not of income

Security depends not so much upon how much you have as upon how much you can do without

Security can only be achieved through constant change through discarding old ideas that have outlived their usefulness and adapting others to current facts

Truth is the only safe ground to stand upon

Only in growth reform and change paradoxically enough is true security to be found

Security is not the absence of danger but the presence of God no matter what the danger

Im in love with the potential of miracles For me the safest place is out on a limb

Mans security comes from within himself

You are all you will ever have for certain

No one can builu her security upon the nobleness of another person

Your real security is yourself You know you can do it and they cant ever take that away from you

Only those means of security are good are certain are lasting that depend on yourself and your own vigor

Uncertainty and expectation are the joys of life Security is an insipid thing

Freedom works

To be on the alert is to live to be lulled into security is to die

Prudence keeps life safe but does not often make it happy

Whatever course you have chosen for yourself it will not be a chore but an adventure if you bring to it a sense of the glory of striving if your sights are set far above the merely secure and mediocre

Security is a kind of death

Without danger we cannot get beyond danger Each one of us requires the spur of insecurity to force us to do our best

Nerves provide me with energy Its when I dont have them when I feel at ease that I get worried

Protection and security are only valuable if they do not cramp life excessively

Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity they seem more afraid of life than of death

The one permanent emotion of the inferior man is fearfear of the unknown the complex the inexplicable What he wants beyond everything else is safety

We spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it

Be like the bird that passing on her flight awhile on boughs too slight feels them give way beneath her and yet sings knowing that she hath wings

We hear of a silent generation more concerned with security than integrity with conforming than performing with imitating than creating

A man cannot be comfortable without his own approval

An old man concludeth from his knowing mankind that they know him too and that maketh him very wary

A sick man that gets talking about himself a woman that gets talking about her baby and an author that begins reading out of his own book never know when to stop

Each man must look to himself to teach him the meaning of life It is not something discovered it is something moulded

Egotism the art of seeing in yourself what others cannot see

Every one is bound to bear patiently the results of his own example

He who is in love with himself has at least this advantage he wont encounter many rivals

If you cant bite dont show your teeth

Know him know me

Man who man would be must rule the empire of himself

No man does anything from a single motive

Nobody can honestly think of himself as a strong character because however successful he may be in overcoming them he is necessarily aware of the doubts and temptations that accompany every important choice

We carry with us the wonders we seek without us

What the collective age wants allows and approves is the perpetual holiday from the self

When a man is wrapped up in himself he makes a pretty small package

Whos not sat tense before his own hearts curtain

If a man really knew himself he would utterly despise the ignorant notions others might form on a subject in which he had such matchless opportunities for observation

With every physical pain my moral fibre unravels a little

I have never seen a greater monster or miracle in the world than myself

We are all serving a life sentence in the dungeon of self

One may understand the cosmos but never the ego the self is more distant than any star

We judge ourselves by our motives and others by their actions

There is nothing noble about being superior to some other man The true nobility is in being superior to your previous self

Selfconfidence is the first requisite to great undertakings

Never to talk of oneself is a form of hypocrisy

Goethe said there would be little left of him if you were to discard what he owed to others

Be yourself Who else is better qualified

I dont think anyone is free one creates ones own prison

I am I plus my circumstances

I think somehow we learn who we really are and then live with that decision

There is nothing will kill a man so soon as having nobody to find fault with but himself

I am as bad as the worst but thank God I am as good as the best

A man can stand a lot as long as he can stand himself He can live without hope without friends without books even without music as long as he can listen to his own thoughts

If you really do put a small value upon yourself rest assured that the world will not raise your price

If I am not for myself who will be

The greatest success is successful selfacceptance

Compassion for myself is the most powerful healer of them all

Selfrespect is the root of discipline the sense of dignity grows with the ability to say no to oneself

If you know nothing be pleased to know nothing

I am more afraid of my own heart than of the Pope and all his cardinals I have within me the great Pope Self

The happy man is he who knows his limitations yet bows to no false gods

From without no wonderful effect is wrought within ourselves unless some interior responding wonder meets it

Nobody knows whats in him until he tries to pull it out If theres nothing or very little the shock can kill a man

Blessed are they who heal us of selfdespisings Of all services which can be done to man I know of none more precious

When three people call you an ass put on a bridle

A complete life may be one ending in so full an identification with the notself that there is no self left to die

A show of envy is an insult to oneself

Maturity consists of no longer being taken in by oneself

Our own interests are still an exquisite means for dazzling our eyes agreeably

To penetrate ones being one must go armed to the teeth

Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings

Selfreverence selfknowledge selfcontrol these three alone lead to sovereign power

There are limits to selfindulgence none to selfrestraint

Integrity simply means a willingness not to violate ones identity

The important thing is not what they think of me it is what I think of them

I think Dostoevsky was right that every human being must have a point at which he stands against the culture where he says this is me and the damned world can go to hell

O wad some Powr the giftie gie us To see oursels as others see us It wad frae money a blunder free us And foolish notion

Selfrespecting people do not care to peep at their reflections in unexpected mirrors or to see themselves as others see them

Selfcommand is the main elegance

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent

I am better than my reputation

Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradict myself I am large I contain multitudes

Be thine own palace or the worlds thy jail

Do not make yourself so big You are not so small

Individualism is rather like innocence there must be something unconscious about it

I am as my Creator made me and since He is satisfied so am I

I live in the crowds of jollity not so much to enjoy company as to shun myself

I refuse to try to explain everything because if you know too much about yourself you become impotent Better not to know what it is that makes you tick

Every man shall bear his own burden

I seem to have an awful lot of people inside me

There is no crime of which I do not deem myself capable

I shall stay the way I am Because I do not give a damn

I have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle

God knows Im no the thing I should be Nor am I even the thing I could be

In the main it is not by introspection but by reflecting on our living in common with others that we come to know ourselves What is revealed It is an original creation Freely the subject makes himself what he is never in this life is the making finished always it is in process always it is a precarious achievement that can slip and fall and shatter

Im a vague conjunctured personality more made up of opinions and academic prepossessions than of human traits and red corpuscles

to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting

Learn what you are and be such

My great mistake the fault for which I cant forgive myself is that one day I ceased my obstinate pursuit of my own individuality

A man must learn to forgive himself

I have come back again to where I belong not an enchanted place but the walls are strong

Theres only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving and thats your own self

It is not only the most difficult thing to know oneself but the most inconvenient one too

To know oneself one should assert oneself

Every new adjustment is a crisis in selfesteem

There is no greater delight than to be conscious of sincerity on selfexamination

Whatever you may be sure of be sure of this that you are dreadfully like other people

All life is the struggle the effort to be itself The difficulties which I meet with in order to realize my existence are precisely what awaken and mobilize my activities my capacities

My closest relation is myself

I care not so much what I am to others as what I am to myself I will be rich by myself and not by borrowing

You can succeed if nobody else believes it but you will never succeed if you dont believe in yourself

Cautious careful people always casting about to preserve their reputation and social standing never can bring about a reform

Everybody wants to do something to help but nobody wants to be first

It is not easy to be a pioneerbut oh it is fascinating I would not trade one moment even the worst moment for all the riches in the world

Do not attempt to do a thing unless you are sure of yourself but do not relinquish it simply because someone else is not sure of you

No one can make you feel inferior without your consent

Every man stamps his value on himself man is made great or small by his own will

The decision to speak out is the vocation and lifelong peril by which the intellectual must live

Let us not forget that among womens rights is the right to speak freely

Let a mans talents or virtues be what they may he will only feel satisfaction as he is satisfied in himself

Ive always tried to go a step past wherever people expected me to end up

When I have been unhappy I have heard an opera and it seemed the shrieking of winds when I am happy a sparrows chirp is delicious to me But it is not the chirp that makes me happy but I that make it sweet

The US Constitution doesnt guarantee happiness only the pursuit of it You have to catch up with it yourself

To believe that if only we had this or that we would be happy or to pursue any excessive desire diverts us from seeing that happiness depends on an adequate self

Nothing can bring you peace but yourself

Happiness belongs to those who are sufficient unto themselves For all external sources of happiness and pleasure are by their very nature highly uncertain precarious ephemeral and subject to chance

All times are beautiful for those who maintain joy within them but there is no happy or favorable time for those with disconsolate or orphaned souls

Felicity felicity is quaffed out of a golden cup the flavour is with you alone and you can make it as intoxicating as you please

Some pursue happiness others create it

To be obliged to beg our daily happiness from others bespeaks a more lamentable poverty than that of him who begs his daily bread

Man is the artificer of his own happiness

To wait for someone else or to expect someone else to make my life richer or fuller or more satisfying puts me in a constant state of suspension

I am my own heaven and hell

I am responsible for my own wellbeing my own happiness The choices and decisions I make regarding my life directly influence the quality of my days

If you do not find peace in yourself you will never find it anywhere else

To know what you prefer instead of humbly saying Amen to what the world tells you that you ought to prefer is to have kept your soul alive

If people are suffering then they must look within themselves Happiness is not something readymade Buddha can give you It comes from your own actions

Blame yourself if you have no branches or leaves dont accuse the sun of partiality

The opportunities for enjoyment in your life are limitless If you feel you are not experiencing enough joy you have only yourself to blame

Happiness is like time and spacewe make and measure it ourselves it is as fancy as big as little as you please just a thing of contrasts and comparisons

It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves and it is not possible to find it elsewhere

The greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves

No human being can really understand another and no one can arrange anothers happiness

Noone gives joy or sorrow We gather the consequences of our own deeds

Happiness depends upon ourselves

The amount of satisfaction you get from life depends largely on your own ingenuity selfsufficiency and resourcefulness People who wait around for life to supply their satisfaction usually find boredom instead

Somebodys boring me I think its me

Being bored is an insult to oneself

When people are bored it is primarily with their own selves that they are bored

If your daily life seems poor do not blame it blame yourself tell yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches

Lifes under no obligation to give us what we expect

One has to handle these negative experiences alone You cant get help from your friends or family Youre finally alone with it and you have to come to grips with misfortune and go on

Expect nothing Live frugally on surprise

If you want to succeed you must make your own opportunities as you go

It is sometimes the man who opens the door who is the last to enter the room

If after all men cannot always make history have a meaning they can always act so that their own lives have one

Every man is the architect of his own fortune

A wise man will make more opportunities than he finds

Man is still responsible His success lies not with the stars but with himself He must carry on the fight of selfcorrection and discipline

No one can help you in holding a good job except Old Man You

No man will succeed unless he is ready to face and overcome difficulties and prepared to assume responsibilities

The brave man carves out his fortune and every man is the sum of his own works

Under normal periods any mans success hinges about 5 percent on what others do for him and 95 percent on what he does

If a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up

Pa he always said a man had to look spry for himself because nobody would do it for him your opportunities didnt come knocking around you had to hunt them down and hogtie them

Destiny is not a matter of chance it is a matter of choice it is not a thing to be waited for it is a thing to be achieved

Men at some time are masters of their fates

The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want and if they cant find them make them

Mistakes fail in their mission of helping the person who blames them on the other fellow

We have not passed that subtle line between childhood and adulthood until we have stopped saying It got lost and say I lost it

Do not blame anybody for your mistakes and failures

The day you take complete responsibility for yourself the day you stop making excuses thats the day you start your move to the top

It is a painful thing to look at your own trouble and know that you yourself and no one else has made it

When you blame others you give up your power to change

Take your life in your own hands and what happens A terrible thing no one to blame

What fate can be worse than to know we have no one but ourselves to blame for our misfortunes

Fair play with others is primarily not blaming them for anything that is wrong with us

How we love to blame others for our misfortunes Almost every individual who has lost money in stock speculation has on the tip of his tongue an explanation which he trots out to show that it wasnt his own fault at all Hardly one loser has the manliness to say frankly I was wrong

Man must cease attributing his problems to his environment and learn again to exercise his personal responsibility in the realm of faith and morals

The greatest griefs are those we cause ourselves

The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves

A chief is a man who assumes responsibility He does not say My men were beaten he says I was beaten

Debt is a trap which man sets and baits himself and then deliberately gets into

God helps those who help themselves

I feel no need for any other faith than my faith in human beings

It is vain to ask of the gods what man is capable of supplying for himself

The gods help those who help themselves

Ask Gods blessing on your work but dont ask him to do it for you

He who prays and labours lifts his heart to God with his hands

God gives every bird its food but he does not throw it into the nest

Trust in Allah but tie your camel first

Put your trust in God my boys and keep your powder dry

God loves to help him who strives to help himself

Religious faith indeed relates to that which is above us but it must arise from that which is within us

Even God lends a hand to honest boldness

Help yourself and heaven will help you

God has entrusted me with myself

The Ancient Mariner said to Neptune during a great storm O God you will save me if you wish but I am going to go on holding my tiller straight

If your ship doesnt come in swim out to it

To character and success two things contradictory as they may seem must go togetherhumble dependence and manly independence humble dependence on God and manly reliance on self

I am a moonbeam free to go whenever I choose

My will shall shape my future Whether I fail or succeed shall be no mans doing but my own I am the force I can clear any obstacle before me or I can be lost in the maze My choice my responsibility win or lose only I hold the key to my destiny

I had never been as resigned to readymade ideas as I was to readymade clothes perhaps because although I couldnt sew I could think

Selfreliance is the only road to true freedom and being ones own person is its ultimate reward

The basic freedom of the world is womans freedom

Never grow a wishbone daughter where your backbone ought to be

You are the handicap you must face You are the one who must choose your place

The best and most efficient pharmacy is within your own system

I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul

Champions take responsibility When the ball is coming over the net you can be sure I want the ball

A man is a lion in his own cause

For they can conquer who believe they can

I have ever held it as a maxim never to do that through another which it was possible for me to execute myself

Doubt whom you will but never yourself

No man should part with his own individuality and become that of another

Think wrongly if you please but in all cases think for yourself

Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends

Then out spake brave Horatius The captain of the gate To every man upon this earth Death cometh soon or late And how can man die better Than facing fearful odds For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his gods

The force of selfishness is as inevitable and as calculable as the force of gravitation

The same people who can deny others everything are famous for refusing themselves nothing

That man who lives for self alone Lives for the meanest mortal known

Selfishness is the only real atheism aspiration unselfishness the only real religion

They also serve who only stand and wait

Servant of God well done

They serve God well Who serve his creatures

My heart is ever at your service

He profits most who serves best

Ill wager that in ten years it will be fashionable again to be a virgin

Sex is an emotion in motion

Sex is a relatively recent addition to the dance of life For more than 2000000000 years asexual reproduction was the rule You know if you were a creature you just separated into two clones

Sex unlike justice should not be seen to be done

The reason that husbands and wives do not understand each other is because they belong to different sexes

There will be sex after death we just wont be able to feel it

Twoparent sex appeared on the scene about 500000000 years ago

When she raises her eyelids its as if she were taking off all her clothes

Sex is the great amateur art

Of all sexual aberrations perhaps the most peculiar is chastity

Ive looked on a lot of women with lust Ive committed adultery in my heart many times This is something God recognizes I will do and I have done it and God forgives me for it

The big difference between sex for money and sex for free is that sex for money usually costs a lot less

Whatever else can be said about sex it cannot be called a dignified performance

Sex the poor mans polo

Lord make me chaste but not yet

The natural man has only two primal passions to get and beget

Amoebas at the start were not complex They tore themselves apart and started sex

Every animal is sad after intercourse

As a matter of biology if something bites you it is probably female

Sex ought to be a wholly satisfying link between two affectionate people from which they emerge unanxious rewarded and ready for more

When a man tells me hes run out of steam in the sex department Ill tell him Count your blessings youve escaped from the clutches of a cruel tyrant Enjoy

While a person does not give up on sex sex does not give up on the person

I wasnt kissing her I was whispering in her mouth

I like American women They do things sexually Russian girls would never dream of doing like showering

All men look at Dr Ruth and wonder how she has gained all that sexual experience

The cable TV sex channels dont expand our horizons dont make us better people and dont come in clearly enough

Is sex dirty Only if its done right

If it werent for pickpockets Id have no sex life at all

Its been so long since I made love I cant even remember who gets tied up

A promiscuous person is someone who is getting more sex than you are

Sex is one of the nine reasons for reincarnation The other eight are unimportant

I am always looking for meaningful onenight stands

Accept every blind date you can get even with a girl who wears jeans Maybe you can talk her out of them

For birth control I rely on my personality

Personally I know nothing about sex because Ive always been married

Sex is like money only too much is enough

Im at the age when food has taken the place of sex in my life In fact Ive just had a mirror put over my kitchen table

I was with this girl the other night and from the way she was responding to my skillful caresses you would have sworn she was conscious from the top of her head to the tag on her toes

If there is reincarnation Id like to come back as Warren Beattys fingertips

There are a number of mechanical devices which increase sexual arousal particularly in women Chief among these is the MercedesBenz 380 SL convertible

What shadows we are what shadows we pursue

Coming events cast their shadows before

Shadows are in reality when the sun is shining the most conspicuous thing in a landscape next to the highest lights

He was not of an age but for all time

Shakespeare has had neither equal nor second

Shame is an ornament to the young a disgrace to the old

I count him lost who is lost to shame

We live in an atmosphere of shame We are ashamed of everything that is real about us ashamed of ourselves of our relatives of our incomes of our accents of our opinion of our experience just as we are ashamed of our naked skins

O shame Where is they blush

A leap year Is never a good sheep year

One for the master And one for my dame And one for the little boy Who lives in the lane

Dont give up the ship

Ships that pass in the night

They that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters

Ships are but boards sailors but men

There breaks in every Gloucester wave A windowed womans heart

Him that makes shoes go barefoot himself

I can tell where my own shoe pinches me

Sickness is a belief which must be annihilated by the divine Mind

Prevention is better than cure

The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint

How could the drops of water know themselves to be a river Yet the river flows on

Silence is as full of potential wisdom and wit as the unhewn marble of great sculpture

The silent dog is the first to bite

We need a reason to speak but none to keep silent

Silence is the unbearable repartee

That mans silence is wonderful to listen to

I believe in the discipline of silence and could talk for hours about it

He has the gift of quiet

Im exhausted from not talking

The cruellest lies are often told in silence

Nature has given to men one tongue but two ears that we may hear from others twice as much as we speak

Silence is the most perfect expression of scorn

Speech may be barren but it is ridiculous to suppose that silence is always brooding on a nestful of eggs

Silence propagates itself and the longer talk has been suspended the more difficult it is to find anything to say

The most silent people are generally those who think most highly of themselves

The greatest triumphs of propaganda have been accomplished not by doing something but by refraining from doing Great is truth but still greater from a practical point of view is silence about truth

Men fear silence as they fear solitude because both give them a glimpse of the terror of lifes nothingness

Silence is deep as Eternity speech shallow as Time

Better silent than stupid

It is a great misfortune neither to have enough wit to talk well nor enough judgement to be silent

I have noticed that nothing I never said ever did me any harm

One of the best ways to persuade others is with your ears

It is easier to talk than to hold ones tongue

The pause that impressive silence that eloquent silence that geometrically progressive silence which often achieves a desired effect where no combination of words howsoever felicitous could accomplish it

Silence is more eloquent than words

Silence is the unbearable repartee

Speech is silver silence is golden

Still waters run deep

Vessels never give so great a sound as when they are empty

It is a great misfortune neither to have enough wit to talk well nor enough judgment to be silent

Keep quiet and people will think you a philosopher

Blessed are they who have nothing to say and who cannot be persuaded to say it

Be silent and safe silence never betrays you

He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction

The rest is silence

Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep

I regret often that I have spoken never that I have been silent

A speech does not need to be eternal to be immortal

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication

To be simple is to be great

It helped me in the air to keep my small mind contained in earthly human limits not lost in vertiginous space and elements unknown

A man must be able to cut a knot for everything cannot be untied he must know how to disengage what is essential from the detail in which it is enwrapped for everything cannot be equally considered in a word he must be able to simplify his duties his business and his life

Simplicity is an exact medium between too little and too much

Simplicity and naturalness are the truest marks of distinction

The trouble about man is twofold He cannot learn truths which are too complicated he forgets truths which are too simple

Everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler

To be simple is the best thing in the world

If we live we live if we die we die if we suffer we suffer if we are terrified we are terrified There is no problem about it

I have a simple philosophy Fill whats empty Empty whats full And scratch where it itches

Keep breathing

I go about looking at horses and cattle They eat grass make love work when they have to bear their young I am sick with envy of them

What you do not want done to yourself do not do to others

I know only that what is moral is what you feel good after and what is immoral is what you feel bad after

My formula for living is quite simple I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night In between I occupy myself as best I can

Keep doing what youre doing and youll keep getting what youre getting

Life is one long struggle to disinter oneself to keep ones head above the accumulations the ever deepening layers of objects which attempt to cover one over steadily almost irresistibly like falling snow

Is nothing in life ever straight and clear the way children see it

There is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval

We cannot solve lifes problems except by solving them

Eat when youre hungry Drink when youre thirsty Sleep when youre tired

I believe that a simple and unassuming manner of life is best for everyone best both for the body and the mind

If its working keep doing it If its not working stop doing it If you dont know what to do dont do anything

If you dont like something about yourself change it If you cant change it accept it

There is only one meaning of life the act of living itself

I have a simple philosophy Fill whats empty Empty whats full Scratch where it itches

Simplicity is making the journey of this life with just baggage enough

The boy and girl going hand in hand through a meadow the mother washing her baby the sweet simple things in life We have almost lost track of them On the one side we overintellectualize everything on the other hand we are overmechanized We can understand the danger of the atomic bomb but the danger of our misunderstanding the meaning of life is much more serious

Fear less hope more eat less chew more whine less breathe more talk less say more love more and all good things will be yours

I take a simple view of living It is keep your eyes open and get on with it

Love and do what you like

Reduce the complexity of life by eliminating the needless wants of life and the labors of life reduce themselves

Manifest plainness Embrace simplicity Reduce selfishness Have few desires

Simplicity clarity singleness these are the attributes that give our lives power and vividness and joy

I searched through rebellion drugs diet mysticism religion intellectualism and much more only to find that truth is basically simple and feels good clear and right

If you walk just walk If you sit just sit But whatever you do dont wobble

To keep a lamp burning we have to keep putting oil in it

Fame is a pearl many dive for and only a few bring up Even when they do it is not perfect and they sigh for more and lose better things in struggling for them

Life is not complex We are complex Life is simple and the simple thing is the right thing

God made man simple but how he changed and got complicated is hard to say

Making the simple complicated is commonplace making the complicated simple awesomely simple thats creativity

The man of fixed ingrained principles who has mapped out a straight course and has the courage and selfcontrol to adhere to it does not find life complex Complexities are all of our own making

The whole is simpler than the sum of its parts

The course of every intellectual if he pursues his journey long and unflinchingly enough ends in the obvious from which the nonintellectuals have never stirred

Any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent It takes a touch of geniusand a lot of courageto move in the opposite direction

At times almost all of us envy the animals They suffer and die but do not seem to make a problem of it

First say to yourself what you would be and then do what you have to do

If a madman were to come into this room with a stick in his hand no doubt we should pity the state of his mind but our primary consideration would be to take care of ourselves We should knock him down first and pity him afterwards

You decide what it is you want to accomplish and then you lay out your plans to get there and then you just do it Its pretty straightforward

There is a point at which everything becomes simple and there is no longer any question of choice because all you have staked will be lost if you look back Lifes point of no return

The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak

The sculptor produces the beautiful statue by chipping away such parts of the marble block as are not needed it is a process of elimination

A great man is one who seizes the vital issue in a complex question what we might call the jugular vein of the whole organism and spends his energies upon that

The more we reduce the size of our world the more we shall be its master

Simplicity simplicity simplicity I say let your affairs be as two or three and not a hundred or a thousand Simplify simplify

There is no greatness where there is not simplicity

The wisdom of life consists in the elimination of nonessentials

All animals except man know that the ultimate of life is to enjoy it

I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it

Happiness comes of the capacity to feel deeply to enjoy simply to think freely to risk life to be needed

The main obligation is to amuse yourself

There is no cure for birth or death save to enjoy the interval

Success is simple Do whats right the right way at the right time

There is a master key to success with which no man can fail Its name is simplicity reducing to the simplest possible terms every problem

If you want to be found stand where the seeker seeks

Many things are lost for want of asking

Economy prudence and a simple life are the sure masters of need and will often accomplish that which their opposites with a fortune at hand will fail to do

Wealth consists not in having great possessions but in having few wants

If you arent going all the way why go at all

What I do I do very well and what I dont do well I dont do at all

Players have two things to do Play and keep their mouths shut

Hitting is timing Pitching is upsetting timing

All I had to do was keep turning left

The rules of soccer are very simple Basically its this If it moves kick it if it doesnt move kick it until it does

If you dont throw it they cant hit it

Football is blocking and tackling Everything else is mythology

Its a round ball and a round bat and you got to hit it square

There are only five things you can do in baseball run throw catch hit and hit with power

Losers have tons of variety Champions take pride in just learning to hit the same old boring winners

The way you get better at playing football is to play football

I just take my three swings and go sit on the bench I dont ever want to mess up my swing

Just learn your lines and dont bump into the furniture

My advice about acting Speak clearly dont bump into people and if you must have motivation think of your pay packet on Friday

Dont let go of the vine

Stay out of jail

Putting aside all the fancy words and academic doubletalk the basic reason for having a military is to do two jobsto kill people and to destroy the works of man

The first law of war is to preserve ourselves and destroy the enemy

In combat life is short nasty and brutish The issues of national policy which brought him into war are irrelevant to the combat soldier he is concerned with his literal life chances

You dont hurt em if you dont hit em

There is nothing certain about war except that one side wont win

I can always make it a rule to get there first with the most men

The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his

The object of war is to survive it

When ideas come I write them when they dont come I dont

The idea is to get the pencil moving quickly

I never thought of myself as a writer but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing

The niftiest turn of phrase the most elegant flight of rhetorical fancy isnt worth beans next to a clear thought clearly expressed

Get black on white

Art it seems to me should simplify

Its a simple formula do your best and somebody might like it

Simplicity carried to an extreme becomes elegance

All the great things are simple and many can be expressed in a single word freedom justice honor duty mercy hope

It is the essence of genius to make use of the simplest ideas

Genius is the ability to reduce the complicated to the simple

The simplest things give me ideas

If you cant write your idea on the back of my calling card you dont have a clear idea

It is proof of high culture to say the greatest matters in the simplest way

The art of art the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters is simplicity nothing is better than simplicity

True eloquence consists of saying all that should be said and that only

Simplicity of character is no hindrance to subtlety of intellect

Simplicity of character is the natural result of profound thought

The obvious is that which is never seen until someone expresses it simply

Simple style is like white light It is complex but its complexity is not obvious

When an idea is too weak to support a simple statement it is a sign that it should be rejected

When thought is too weak to be simply expressed its clear proof that it should be rejected

The great artist and thinker are the simplifiers

Simple truths are a relief from grand speculations

Nothing is more simple than greatness indeed to be simple is to be great

Simplicity of character is the natural result of profound thought

Affected simplicity is refined imposture

The fewer our wants the nearer we resemble the gods

O sin what hast thou done to this fair earth

He that falls into sin is a man that grieves at it is a saint that boasteth of it is a devil

Proverty and wealth are comparative sins

He that is without sin among you let him cast the first stone

The sin they do by two and two they must pay for one by one

So many laws argue so many sins

It is not alone what we do but also what we do not do for which we are accountable

In Adams Fall We sinned all

0 thou who didst with pitfall and with gin Beset the road I was to wander in Thou wilt not with predestind evil round Enmesh and then impute my fall to sin

My son if sinners entice thee consent thou not

The way of transgressors is hards

The wages of sinis death

I am a man More sinnd against than sinning

Of all the evil spirits abroad at this hour in the world insincerity is the most dangerous

There is no greater delight than to be conscious of sincerity on selfexamination

A little sincerity is a dangerous thing and a great deal of it is absolutely fatal

Skepticism means not intellectual doubt alone but moral doubt

With most people doubt about one thing is simply blind belief in another

Skeptics are never deceived

I am ready to reject all belief and reasoning and can look upon no opinion even as more probable or likely than another

Believe nothing and be on your guard against everything

Great intellects are skeptical

And that inverted Bowl they call the Sky Whereunder crawling coopd we live and die Lift not your hands to it for help for it As impotently moves as you or I

Sometimes gentle sometimes capricious sometimes awful never the same for two moments together almost human in its passions almost spiritual in its tenderness almost Divine in its infinity

A slander is like a hornet if you cannot kill it dead the first blow better not strike at it

If slander be a snake it is a winged one it flies as well as creeps

I am disgracd impeachd and baffled here Piercd to the soul with slanders venomd spear

If you put a chain around the neck of a slave the other end fastens itself around your own

The compact which exists between the North and the South is a covenant with death and an agreement with hell involving both parties in atrocious criminality and should be immediately annulled

I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free

Corrupted freemen are the worst slaves

The man who gives me employment which I must have or suffer that man is my master let me call him what I will

They are slaves who fear to speak For the fallen and the weak They are slaves who dare not be In the right with two or three

They the blacks had no right which the white man was bound to respect

Englishmen never will be slaves they are free to do whatever the Government and public opinion allow them to do

The feeling of sleepiness when you are not in bed and cant get there is the meanest feeling in the world

Did anyone ever have a boring dream

The sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep

Sleep that knits up the ravelled sleave of care The death of each days life sore labours bath Balm of hurt minds great natures second course Chief nourisher in lifes feast

Over my slumber your loving watch keep Rock me to sleep mother rock me to sleep

Fatigue is the best pillow

Sleep is the best cure for waking troubles

One hours sleep before midnight is worth three after

Soft closer of our eyes Low murmur of tender lullabies

Sleep rest of nature O sleep most gentle of the divinities peace of the soul thou at whose presence care disappears who soothest hearts wearied with daily employments and makest them strong again for labour

I will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou Lord only makest me dwell in safety

He giveth His beloved sleep

I never sleep comfortably except when I am at sermon or when I pray to God

To all to each a fair goodnight And pleasing dreams and slumbers light

She slept the sleep of the just

To sleep perchance to dream ay theres the rub For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil Must give us pause

O sleep O gentle sleep Natures soft nurse

Hush my dear lie still and slumber Holy angels guard they bed Heavenly blessings without number Gently falling on thy head

Ive had a lot of experience with people smarter than I am

The smartest thing I ever said was Help Me

A smart husband buys his wife very fine china so she wont trust him to wash it

After pleasant scratching comes unpleasant smarting

I am not the smartest or most talented person in the world but I succeeded because I keep going and going and going

Cats are smarter than dogs You cant get eight cats to pull a sled through snow

Smiles form the channels of a future tear

Tis easy enough to be pleasant When life flows along like a song But the man worth while is the one who will smile When everything goes dead wrong

Whats the use of worrying It never was worth while so Pack up your troubles in your old kitbag And smile smile smile

Its full of worth and goodness too with manly kindness blent Its worth a million dollars and it doesnt cost a cent

Who can refute a sneer

It is just as hard to do your duty when men are sneering at you as when they are shooting at you

The public has a taste for supping with the great

Laughter would be bereaved if snobbery died

The true definition of a snob is one who craves for what separates men rather than for what unites them

No place in England where everyone can go is considered respectable

Snobs talk as if they had begotten their ancestors

A highbrow is a person educated beyond his intelligence

All the people like us are We And everyone else is They

The true snob never rests there is always a higher goal to attain and there are by the same token always more and more people to look down upon

Year of snow Fruit will grow

But where are the snows of yesteryear

These monstrous views these venomous teachings

All Socialism involves slavery

Every generation is a secret society and has incommunicable enthusiasm tastes and interests which are a mystery both to its predecessor and to posterity

Fools take to themselves the respect that is given to their office Aesop It is time in the West to defend not so much human rights as human obligations

Society is commonly too cheap We meet at very short intervals not having had time to acquire any new value for each other We meet at meals three times a day and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are

Somerset House in London where at one time English vital statistics were kept birth marriage and death records was known as the egg factory where they hatch em match em and dispatch em

Socialism must come down from the brain and reach the heart

Society can only exist on the basis that there is some amount of polished lying and that no one says exactly what he thinks

The cocktail party as the name itself indicates was originally invented by dogs They are simply bottomsniffings raised to the rank of formal ceremonies

Two people can form a community by excluding a third

The world has narrowed to a neighbourhood before it has broadened to a brotherhood

There are only two families in the world as a Grandmother of mine used to say the haves and the havenots

What is a Communist One who hath yearnings for equal division of unequal earnings

Society is composed of two great classes those who have more dinners than appetite and those who have more appetite than dinners

The complacent the selfindulgent the soft societies are about to be swept away with the debris of history

Society is now one polished horde Formed of two mighty tribes The Bores and the Bored

Society dead or alive can have no charm without intimacy and no intimacy without an interest in trifles

To be social is to be forgiving

If a free society cannot help the many who are poor it cannot save the few who are rich

The difference between our decadence and the Russians is that while theirs is brutal ours is apathetic

The cocktail party a device for paying off obligations to people you dont want to invite to dinner

Vigorous societies harbour a certain extravagance of objectives

In any assembly the simplest way to stop the transacting of business and split the ranks is to appeal to a principle

Tolerably early in life I discovered that one of the unpardonable sins in the eyes of most people is for a man to go about unlabeled The world regards such a person as the police do an unmuzzled dog

Twenty per cent of the people in volunteer groups do ninety per cent of the work

Nothing is so dangerous as being too modern one is apt to grow oldfashioned quite suddenly

Gentleman one who never hurts anyones feelings unintentionally

Etiquette means behaving yourself a little better than is absolutely essential

The best things and best people rise out of their separateness Im against a homogenized society because I want the cream to rise

There are four varieties in society the lovers the ambitious observers and fools The fools are the happiest

Whatever people may say the fastidious formal manner of the upper classes is preferable to the slovenly easygoing behaviour of the common middle class In moments of crisis the former know how to act the latter become uncouth brutes

The classes that wash most are those that work least

Necessity is the constant scourge of the lower classes ennui of the higher ones

Society my dear is like salt water good to swim in but hard to swallow

Only a few human beings should grow to the square mile they are commonly planted too close

Tis the final conflict Let each stand in his place The international working class shall be the human race

Every society honours its live conformists and its dead troublemakers

In order to stand well in the eyes of the community it is necessary to come up to a certain somewhat indefinite conventional standard of wealth

Class is an aura of confidence that is being sure without being cocky Class has nothing to do with money Class never runs scared It is selfdiscipline and selfknowledge Its the surefootedness that comes with having proved you can meet life

I respect kindness in human beings first of all and kindness to animals I dont respect the law I have a total irreverance for anything connected with society except that which makes the roads safer the beer stronger the food cheaper and the old men and old women warmer in the winter and happier in the summer

Every man is a consumer and ought to be a producer

These families you know are our upper crust not upper ten thousand

He might have proved a useful adjunct if not an ornament to society

Man is a social animal

It is impossible in our condition of Society not to be sometimes a Snob

To get into the best society nowadays one has either to feed people amuse people or shock people

The king of France with twenty thousand men Went up the hill and then came down again The king of Spain with twenty thousand more Climbed the same hill the French had climbed before

God and a soldier all people adore In time of war but not before And when war is over and all things are righted God is neglected and an old soldier slighted

Home they brought her warrior dead

How sleep the brave who sink to rest By all their countrys wishes blest

We are coming Father Abraham three hundred thousand more

Every citizen should be a soldier This was the case with the Greeks and Romans and must be that of every free state

For its Tommy this an Tommy that and Chuck im out the brute But its Savior of is country when the guns begin to shoot

It is not the guns or armament Or the money they can pay Its the close cooperation That makes them win the day It is not the individual Or the army as a whole But the everlastin teamwork Of every bloomin soul

A soldier is an anachronism of which we must get rid

But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

The muffled drums sad roll has beat The soldiers last tattoo No more on Lifes parade shall meet The brave and fallen few On Fames eternal campingground Their silent tents are spread And Glory guards with solemn round The bivouac of the dead

I want to see you shoot the way you shout

There are three things a man must do alone Be born die and testify

Solitary trees if they grow at all grow strong

We never touch but at points

I was never less alone than when by myself

In the world a man lives in his own age in solitude in all ages

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude

If from Society we learn to live Tis Solitude should teach us how to die It hath no flatterers

Solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character

One can acquire everything in solitude but character

Solitude is the profoundest fact of the human condition Man is the only being who knows he is alone

Its a rather pleasant experience to be alone in a bank at night

Were all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skins for life

To dare to live alone is the rarest courage since there are many who had rather meet their bitterest enemy in the field than their own hearts in their closet

One of the greatest necessities in America is to discover creative solitude

Secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster

Night when words fade and things come alive when the destructive analysis of day is done and all that is truly important becomes whole and sound again When man reassembles his fragmentary self and grows with the calm of a tree

In solitude when we are least alone

We enter the world alone we leave it alone

Far from the madding crowds ignoble strife

Alone alone all all alone Alone on a wide wide sea

I praise the Frenchman his remark was shrewd How sweet how passing sweet is solitude But grant me still a friend in my retreat Whom I may whisper Solitude is sweet

The strongest man is the one who stands most alone

Solitude is as needful to the imagination as society is wholesome for the character

The thoughtful Soul to Solitude retires

I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude

Swans sing before they die twere no bad thing Should certain persons die before they sing

A song will outlive all sermons in the memory

The morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy

And so make life death and that vast forever One grand sweet song

God sent his Singers upon earth With songs of sadness and of mirth That they might touch the hearts of men And bring them back to heaven again

Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought

Whats gone and whats past help should be past grief

About suffering they were never wrong The Old Masters How well they understood Its human position how it takes place While someone else is eating or opening a window or just walking dully along

Excessive sorrow laughs Excessive joy weeps

Hes simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed

One cannot weep for the entire world It is beyond human strength One must choose

Should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings

Sorrow makes us all children again

There are some men above grief and some men below it

Unhurt people are not much good in the world

In extreme youth in our most humiliating sorrow we think we are alone When we are older we find that others have suffered too

The deeper the sorrow the less tongue it hath

When sorrows come they come not as single spies But in battalions

Men who are unhappy like men who sleep badly are always proud of the fact

What man is there that does not laboriously though all unconsciously himself fashion the sorrow that is to be the pivot of his life

Only onefourth of the sorrow in each mans life is caused by outside uncontrollable elements the rest is selfimposed by failing to analyze and act with calmness

There is something pleasurable in calm remembrance of a past sorrow

The poor and the busy have no leisure for sentimental sorrow

While grief is fresh every attempt to divert it only irritates

No one can keep his griefs in their prime they use themselves up

Sorrow is a fruit God does not allow it to grow on a branch that is too weak to bear it

There are few sorrows however poignant in which a good income is of no avail

The busy have no time for tears

I walked a mile with Sorrow And neer a word said she But oh the things I learned from her When Sorrow walked with me

Every noble crown is and on earth will ever be a crown of thorns

All sorrows are bearable if there is bread

Hang sorrow carell kill a cat

To Sorrow I bade goodmorrow And thought to leave her far away behind But cheerly cheerly She loves me dearly She is so constant to me and so kind

Sorrows are like thunderclouds in the distance they look black over our heads scarcely gray

The deeper the sorrow the less tongue hath it

Joy was a flame in me Too steady to destroy Lithe as a bending reed Loving the storm that sways her I found more joy in sorrow Than you could find in joy

More in sorrow than in anger

There can be no rainbow without a cloud and a storm

John Browns body lies a mouldring in the grave His soul goes marching on

The one thing in the world of value is the active soul

It matters not how strait the gate How charged with punishments the scroll I am the master of my fate I am the captain of my soul

Out of the night that covers me Black as the Pit from pole to pole I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul

Soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry

What is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul

I sent my Soul through the Invisible Some letter of that Afterlife to spell And by and by my Soul returned to me And answered I Myself am Heavn and Hell

The iron entered into his soul

Self is the only prison that can ever bind the soul

A charge to keep I have A God to glorify A neverdying soul to save And fit it for the sky

I loafe and invite my soul I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass

The windows of my soul I throw Wide open to the sun

The empty vessel makes the greatest sound

Hark from the tombs a doleful sound

A man does not know what he is saying until he knows what he is not saying

Even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth

He rose without a friend and sat down without an enemy

Language most shows a man speak that I may see thee

Little said is soon amended There is always time to add a word never to withdraw one

None love to speak so much when the mood of speaking comes as they who are naturally taciturn

Nothing is so unbelievable that oratory cannot make it acceptable

Speak clearly if you speak at all Carve every word before you let it fall

The relationship of the toastmaster to the speaker should be the same as that of the fan to the fan dancer It should call attention to the subject without making any particular effort to cover it

Though old the thought and oft exprest tis his at last who says it best

To know how to say what others only know how to think is what makes men poets or sages and to dare to say what others only dare to think makes men martyrs or reformers or both

Whatever is well said by another is mine

Winston Churchill has devoted the best years of his life to preparing his impromptu speeches

Would you persuade speak of interest not of reason

It is terrible to speak well and be wrong

All the great speakers were bad speakers at first

If the announcer can produce the impression that he is a gentleman he may pronounce as he pleases

A dull speaker like a plain woman is credited with all the virtues for we charitably suppose that a surface so unattractive must be compensated by interior blessings

Once you get people laughing theyre listening and you can tell them almost anything

Speak what you think today in words as hard as cannon balls and tomorrow speak what tomorrow thinks in hard words again though it contradict everything you said today

When a man gets talking about himself he seldom fails to be eloquent and often reaches the sublime

In an easy cause any man may be eloquent

The object of oratory alone is not truth but persuasion

If no thought your mind does visit make your speech not too explicit

Oratory the art of making deep noises from the chest sound like important messages from the brain

The glittering generalities of the speaker have left an impression more delightful than permanent

Say what you have to say and the first time you come to a sentence with a grammatical ending sit down

First learn the meaning of what you say and then speak

When a man is asked to make a speech the first thing he has to decide is what to say

Ive never thought my speeches were too long Ive rather enjoyed them

Blessed is the man who having nothing to say abstains from giving us wordy evidence of the fact

Look wise say nothing and grunt Speech was given to conceal thought

I have learnt a good deal from my own talk

Speech is the small change of silence

If you dont say anything you wont be called on to repeat it

In Maine we have a saying that theres no point in speaking unless you can improve on silence

If you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever Use a piledriver Hit the point once Then come back and hit it again Then hit it a third time a tremendous whack

He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer than the staple of his argument

That which is repeated too often becomes insipid and tedious

Let him now speak or else hereafter for ever hold his peace

His speech was a fine sample on the whole Of rhetoric which the learnd call rigmarole

Speech is silvern silence is golden

He mouths a sentence as curs mouth a bone

A sophistical rhetorician inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity

I will sit down now but the time will come when you will hear me

The harebrained chatter of irresponsible frivolity

For that man is detested by me as the gates of hell whose outward words conceal his inmost thoughts

His speech flowed from his tongue sweeter than honey

For Gods sake let us freely hear both sides

Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth and every other man has a right to knock him down for it

Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of vou

They think that they shall be heard for their much speaking

Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh

If you your lips would keep from slips Five things observe with care To whom you speak of whom you speak And how and when and where

Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men

It is a tiresome way of speaking when you should despatch the business to beat about the bush

Let no one be willing to speak ill of the absent

A soft answer turneth away wrath

He replies nothing but monosyllables I believe he would make three bites of a cherry

Speak after the manner of men

Speech is the index of the mind

I disapprove of what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it

The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak

He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city

When I use the word spirituality I dont necessarily mean religion I mean whatever it is that helps you feel connected to something that is larger than yourself

The spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it

The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower share a bit of knowledge and it becomes anothers smile at someone and receive a smile in return are to me continual spiritual exercises

Faith is the evidence of things not seen

They understand but little who understand only what can be explained

Some things have to be believed to be seen

Faith is like electricity You cant see it but you can see the light

Faith is the strength by which a shattered world shall emerge into the light

Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around

If you cant have faith in what is held up to you for faith you must find things to believe in yourself for life without faith in something is too narrow a space to live

I am one of those who would rather sink with faith than swim without it

If a blade of grass can grow in a concrete walk and a fig tree in the side of a mountain cliff a human being empowered with an invincible faith can survive all odds the world can throw against his tortured soul

Faith is not knowledge of what the mystery of the universe is but the conviction that there is a mystery and that it is greater than us

Faith is our direct link to universal wisdom reminding us that we know more than we have heard or read or studied that we have only to look listen and trust the love and wisdom of the Universal Spirit working through us all

Believe in something larger than yourself

Faith is knowing there is an ocean because you have seen a brook

Faith is above all openness an act of trust in the unknown

Faith is believing before receiving

Faith is not being sure where youre going but going anyway

Faith is to believe what we do not see the reward of this faith is to see what we believe

You can do very little with faith but you can do nothing without it

All things are possible to him who believes

Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark

Do not have your concert first and tune your instruments afterwards Begin the day with God

All my life I have risen regularly at four oclock and have gone into the woods and talked to God There He gives me my orders for the day

The strength of a man consists in finding out the way in which God is going and going in that way too

God gives us always strength enough and sense enough for everything He wants us to do

God gave burdens also shoulders

There is literally nothing that I ever asked to do that I asked the blessed Creator to help me to do that I have not been able to accomplish

Here on earth Gods work must surely be our own

God can dream a bigger dream for you than you can dream for yourself and your role on Earth is to attach yourself to that divine force and let yourself be released to it

We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us Its not just in some of us its in everyone

I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesnt need any advice from me With God in charge I believe everything will work out for the best in the end

In a world filled with causes for worry and anxiety we need the peace of God standing guard over our hearts and minds

Remember that everything has Gods fingerprints on it

There is not a flower that opens not a seed that falls into the ground and not an ear of wheat that nods on the end of its stalk in the wind that does not preach and proclaim the greatness and the mercy of God to the whole world

Millions of angels are at Gods command

The Holy Spirit wants to flow through us and realize all these wonderful possibilities in the world if we only open ourselves and allow it to happen

Do you not know that you are Gods temple and that Gods spirit dwells within you

God does not ask your ability or your inability He asks only your availability

When you have succeeded in enshrining God within your heart you will see Him everywhere

God dwells wherever man lets Him in

God is love

God loves you God doesnt want anyone to be hungry and oppressed He just puts his big arms around everybody and hugs them up against himself

God loves us the way we are but He loves us too much to leave us that way

The best minister is the human heart the best teacher is time the best book is the world the best friend is God

I love God and when you get to know Him you find Hes a Livin Doll

I dont believe in God Just try getting a plumber on the weekend

God comes at last when we think he is farthest off

God gave you a gift of 86400 seconds today Have you used one to say thank you

If you begin to live life looking for the God that is all around you every moment becomes a prayer

Prayer may not change things for you but it for sure changes you for things

Get down on your knees and thank God you are on your feet

Time spent on the knees in prayer will do more to remedy heart strain and nerve worry than anything else

You pray in your distress and in your need would that you might pray also in the fullness of your joy and in your days of abundance

I never went to bed in my life and I never ate a meal in my life without saying a prayer I know my prayers have been answered thousands of times and I know that I never said a prayer in my life without something good coming of it

God answers all our prayers Sometimes the answer is yes Sometimes the answer is no Sometimes the answer is youve got to be kidding

Why is it when we talk to God we are said to be praying and when God talks to us were said to be schizophrenic

A grandfather was walking through his yard when he heard his granddaughter repeating the alphabet in a tone of voice that sounded like a prayer He asked her what she was doing The little girl explained Im praying but I cant think of exactly the right words so Im just saying all the letters and God will put them together for me because He knows what Im thinking

When you recover or discover something that nourishes your soul and brings joy care enough about yourself to make room for it in your life

Its important to be heroic ambitious productive efficient creative and progressive but these qualities dont necessarily nurture the soul The soul has different concerns of equal value downtime for reflection conversation and reverie beauty that is captivating and pleasuring relatedness to the environs and to people and any animals rhythm of rest and activity

Excite the soul and the weather and the town and your condition in the world all disappear the world itself loses its solidity nothing remains but the soul and the Divine Presence in which it lives

The soul is awakened through service

Souls are made of dawnstuff and starshine

I was thrown out of college for cheating on the metaphysics exam I looked into the soul of the boy next to me

Nobody grows old by merely living a number of years People grow old only by deserting their ideals Years wrinkle the face but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul

The purpose of life on earth is that the soul should grow So Growl By doing what is right

The soul is audible not visible

Soul appears when we make room for it

Football combines the two worst features of American life It is violence punctuated by committee meetings

Great sport begins at a point where it has ceased to be healthy

Skate to where the puck is going and not to where its been

I hate all sports as rabidly as a person who likes sports hates common sense

You cant think and hit at the same time

Pro football is like nuclear warfare There are no winners only survivors

Horses and jockeys mature earlier than people which is why horses are admitted to race tracks at the age of two and jockeys before they are old enough to shave

Jogging is very beneficial Its good for your legs and your feet Its also very good for the ground It makes it feel needed

It you watch a game its fun If you play it its recreation If you work at it its golf

Winning can be defined as the science of being totally prepared

Running for money doesnt make you run fast It makes you run first

When you win nothing hurts

Lets win this one for the Gipper

Sports allow men to build up situations of emergency What he then demands of himself is unnecessary achievement and unnecessary sacrifice He artificially creates the tension that he has been spared by affluent society

It is in games that many men discover their paradise

International sport is war without shooting

Fatigue makes cowards of us all

Sports do not build character They reveal it

Every time you win youre reborn when you lose you die a little

Becoming number one is easier than remaining number one

If you arent fired with enthusiasm youll be fired with enthusiasm

Sport is one area where no participant is worried about anothers race religion or wealth and where the only concern is Have you come to play

Behind every tennis player there is another tennis player

Catching a fly ball is a pleasure but knowing what to do with it is a business

Trying to get a fast ball past Hank Aaron is like trying to get the sun past a rooster

Golf is a good walk spoiled

A sportsman is a man who every now and then simply has to get out and kill something Not that hes cruel He wouldnt hurt a fly Its not big enough

Walking is the best possible exercise Habituate yourself to walk very far

Hockey captures the essence of the Canadian experience in the New World In a land so inescapably and inhospitably cold hockey is the dance of life and an affirmation that despite the deathly chill of winter we are alive

The game isnt over until its over

The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong but thats the way to bet

Sport begets tumultuous strife and wrath and wrath begets fierce quarrels and war to the death

Citius altius fortius Swifter higher stronger

Well God is certainly getting an earful tonight

Going to bed with a woman never hurt a ball player Its staying up all night looking for them that does you in

Knute Rockne liked bad losers He said good losers lose too often

Ninety per cent of this game is halfmental

I have never been able to understand why pigeonshooting at Hurlingham should be refined and polite while a ratkilling match in Whitechapel is low

When I play with my cat who knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me

If all the year were playing holidays To sport would be as tedious as to work

When a man wants to murder a tiger he calls it sport wlien the tiger wants to murder him he calls it ferocity

Our team was surprisingly consistent this year We closed with a sevenseven record We lost seven at home and seven on the road

All pro athletes are bilingual They speak English and profanity

I want you all to line up in alphabetical order according to your size

Slumps in life are like soft beds Theyre easy to get into and hard to get out of

They Xrayed my head and found nothing

Go jogging And get hit by a meteor

When I see joggers go by I shout Jim Fixx is dead Fats Domino lives

Everywhere is walking distance if you have the time

Counting both times I cheated this week I won at solitaire twice

You know youre getting old when you start watching golf on TV and enjoying it

As a woman I resent the fact that in golf if I have the highest score Im the loser

He who has the fastest cart never has a bad lie

My best score is 103 but Ive only been playing for fifteen years

Its not that I really cheat at golf I play for my health and a low score makes me feel better

I play in the low eighties If its any hotter than that I wont play

I asked my instructor how I could cut ten strokes off my score He told me to quit on hole 17

I get confused with all the rules in golf Lets say youre playing in LA and your ball lands on a dead body Is your relief one or two club lengths

My golf has really improved even though my score hasnt Im missing the ball much closer now

Gimme An agreement between two losers who cant putt

The reason the pro tells you to keep your head down is so you cant see him laughing

Golf is not a matter of life or death It is much more important than that

player Can I reach it with a five iron caddie Eventually

Golf and sex Two things you can really enjoy without being that good at them

Golf is a good preoccupation but as the meaning of life it lacks a few things

If you watch a game its fun If you play it its recreation If you work at it its golf

By the time a man can afford to lose a golf ball he cant hit that far

This guy is such an obvious cheater that once when he had a hole in one he wrote down zero on his scorecard

My golf is getting better all the time Today I parred all but sixteen holes

Golf is like a love affair if you dont take it seriously its no fun if you do take it seriously it breaks your heart

I dont say my golf game is bad but if I grew tomatoes theyd come up sliced

If people focused on lifes really important matters thered be a shortage of golf clubs

Im not playing with my brotherinlaw today Would you play with a man who improves his lie and cheats on his score Well neither would he

Youve got just one problem You stand too close to the ball after youve hit it

I used to want to shoot my age Now I would just like to shoot my temperature

What a terrible round I only hit two good balls all day and that was when I stepped on a rake in a bunker

Men are very confident people Even a sixtyyearold man with no arms thinks he could play in the Super Bowl if he had to

Stated to a running back after an overly exuberant display of celebration Next time you make a touchdown act like youve been there before

Nobody in football should be called a genius Football players are not like Norman Einstein

My father watched football with the sound off because he lived in fear of hearing the voice of Howard Cosell

Your brain commands your body to Run forward Bend Scoop up the ball Peg it to the infield Then your body says Who me

Baseball it is said is only a game True And the Grand Canyon is only a hole in Arizona Not all holes or games are created equal

Baseball is 90 percent mental The other half is physical

He spends so much time in the sand trap youd think he was in the cast of Baywatcb

If there comes a little thaw Still the air is chill and raw Here and there a patch of snow Dirtier than the ground below Dribbles down a marshy flood Ankledeep you stick in mud In the meadows while you sing This is Spring

Came the Spring with all its splendor All its birds and all its blossoms All its flowers and leaves and grasses

Yet Ah that Spring should vanish with the Rose That Youths sweetscented manuscript should close The Nightingale that in the branches sang Ah whence and whither flown again who knows

In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnishd dove In the Spring a young mans fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love

Hitch your wagon to a star

Silently one by one in the infinite meadows of heaven Blossomed the lovely stars the forgetmenots of the angels

Stars are the daisies that begem The blue fields of the sky

No star is ever lost we once have seen We always may be what we might have been

Her blue eyes sought the west afar For lovers love the western star

These blessed candles of the night

Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Up above the world so high Like a diamond in the sky

A state is a perfect body of free men united together to enjoy common rights and advantages

States are as the men are they grow out of human characters

Ambassadors are the eye and ear of states

Learn to think continentally

Peace commerce and honest friendship with all nations entangling alliances with none

Tis our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world as far I mean as we are now at liberty to do it

You can always get the truth from an American statesman after he has turned seventy or given up all hope of the Presidency

An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the commonwealth

Rides in the whirlwind and directs the storm

He used to raise a storm in a teapot

For many years I was selfappointed inspector of snowstorms and rainstorms and did my duty faithfully

This story will never go down

And what so tedious as a twicetold tale

But that is another story

I cannot tell how the truth may be I say the tale as twas said to me

And thereby hangs a tale

For seldom shall she hear a tale So sad so tender yet so true

I was a stranger and ye took me in

A strangers eyes see clearest

They go from strength to strength

I feel like a Bull Moose

Three things give hardy strength sleeping on hairy mattresses breathing cold air and eating dry food

What does not destroy me makes me strong

Id rather be strongly wrong than weakly right

Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age

If we are strong our strength will speak for itself If we are weak words will be no help

The will is the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man who can see

Strong people dont need strong leaders

Perhaps I am stronger than I think

Strong hope is a much greater stimulant of life than any single realized joy could be

Strong lives are motivated by dynamic purposes

No power is strong enough to be lasting if it labors under the weight of fear

Fear is stronger than arms

Strong people are made by opposition like kites that go up against the wind

Strong men greet war tempest hard times They wish as Pindar said to tread the floors of hell with necessities as hard as iron

Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause

Love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave

What does not destroy me makes me strong

Id rather be strongly wrong than weakly right

Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age

If we are strong our strength will speak for itself If we are weak words will be no help

The will is the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man who can see

Strong people dont need strong leaders

Perhaps I am stronger than I think

Strong hope is a much greater stimulant of life than any single realized joy could be

No power is strong enough to be lasting if it labors under the weight of fear

Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause

Love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave

What does not destroy me makes me strong

Id rather be strongly wrong than weakly right

Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age

If we are strong our strength will speak for itself If we are weak words will be no help

No power is strong enough to be lasting if it labors under the weight of fear

Fear is stronger than arms

Strong people are made by opposition like kites that go up against the wind

Strong and bitter words indicate a weak cause

Love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave

The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight But they while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night

I realized early on that success was tied to not giving up Most people in this business gave up and went on to other things If you simply didnt give up you would outlast the people who came in on the bus with you

Perseverance is a great element of success If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate you are sure to wake up somebody

Four steps to achievement plan purposefully prepare prayerfully proceed positively pursue persistently

The secret of success is constancy of purpose

Im hardnosed about luck I think it sucks Yeah if you spend seven years looking for a job as a copywriter and then one day somebody gives you a job you can say Gee I was lucky I happened to go up there today But dammit I was going to go up there sooner or later in the next seventy years If youre persistent in trying and doing and working you almost make your own fortune

Flaming enthusiasm backed up by horse sense and persistence is the quality that most frequently makes for success

Its the plugging away that will win you the day So dont be a piker old pard Just draw on your grit its so easy to quit Its the keeping your chin up thats hard

No one succeeds without effort Those who succeed owe their success to their perseverance

Big shots are only little shots who keep shooting

Entrepreneurs average 38 failures before final success What sets the successful ones apart is their amazing persistence There are a lot of people out there with good and marketable ideas but pure entrepreneurial types almost never accept defeat

There are no shortcuts to any place worth going

Be of good cheer Do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow You have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles Remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost

The way to succeed is never quit Thats it But really be humble about it You start out lowly and humble and you carefully try to learn an accretion of little things that help you get there

Continuous effortnot strength or intelligenceis the key to unlocking our potential

Plodding wins the race

The difficulties and struggles of today are but the price we must pay for the accomplishments and victories of tomorrow

Let me tell you the secret that has led me to my goal My strength lies solely in my tenacity

A winner never quits and a quitter never wins

It isnt hard to be good from time to time in sports Whats tough is being good every day

If you start to take Vienna take Vienna

Theres such a thin line between winning and losing

Men who have attained things worth having in this world have worked while others idled have persevered when others gave up in despair have practiced early in life the valuable habits of selfdenial industry and singleness of purpose As a result they enjoy in later life the success so often erroneously attributed to good luck

In the realm of ideas everything depends on enthusiasm in the real world all rests on perseverance

It takes time to be a success

Actually Im an overnight success But it took twenty years

It takes time to succeed because success is merely the natural reward for taking time to do anything well

Success generally depends upon knowing how long it takes to succeed

It takes twenty years to make an overnight success

Success is to be measured not so much by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacles which he has overcome

Our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselvesto break our own records to outstrip our yesterdays by our today to do our work with more force than ever before

Success has always been easy to measure It is the distance between ones origins and ones final achievement

How can they say my life is not a success Have I not for more than sixty years got enough to eat and escaped being eaten

Survival is triumph enough

Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of knowing you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming

Success is relative It is what we can make of the mess we have made of things

The conventional army loses if it does not win The guerrilla wins if he does not lose

The man who has done his level best and who is conscious that he has done his best is a success even though the world may write him down a failure

My success is measured by my willingness to keep trying

If youve had a good time playing the game youre a winner even if you lose

On earth we have nothing to do with success or results but only with being true to God and for God Defeat in doing right is nevertheless victory

The reward of a thing well done is to have done it

Id rather be a lamppost in Chicago than a millionaire in any other city

A successful man is he who receives a great deal from his fellow men usually incomparably more than corresponds to his service to them The value of a man however should be seen in what he gives and not in what he is able to receive

There is only one successto be able to spend your life in your own way

We only do well the things we like doing

The only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy what was talent but the art of being completely whatever one happened to be

Success based on anything but internal fulfillment is bound to be empty

All I would tell people is to hold on to what was individual about themselves not to allow their ambition for success to cause them to try to imitate the success of others Youve got to find it on your own terms

For me writing is the only thing that passes the three tests of metier 1 when Im doing it I dont feel that I should be doing something else instead 2 it produces a sense of accomplishment and once in a while pride and 3 its frightening

My mother said to me If you become a soldier youll be a general if you become a monk youll end up as the pope Instead I became a painter and wound up as Picasso

Abasement degradation is simply the manner of life of the man who has refused to be what it is his duty to be

Different people have different duties assigned to them by Nature Nature has given one the power or the desire to do this the other that Each bird must sing with his own throat

A first rate soup is better than a second rate painting

We cant all be heroes because someone has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by

Nature magically suits a man to his fortunes by making them the fruit of his character

Id rather be a lamppost in Chicago than a millionaire in any other city

We succeed in enterprises which demand the positive qualities we possess but we excel in those which can also make use of our defects

A man can do only what he can do But if he does that each day he can sleep at night and do it again the next day

Dont take anyone elses definition of success as your own This is easier said than done

Whatever you are by nature keep to it never desert your own line of talent Be what nature intended you for and you will succeed be anything else and you will be ten thousand times worse than nothing

Ask yourself the secret of your success Listen to your answer and practice it

I cannot do everything but still I can do something and because I cannot do everything I will not refuse to do something that I can do

Starting out to make money is the greatest mistake in life Do what you feel you have a flair for doing and if you are good enough at it the money will come

If a man has a talent and cannot use it he has failed If he has a talent and uses only half of it he has partly failed If he has a talent and learns somehow to use the whole of it he has gloriously succeeded and won a satisfaction and a triumph few men ever know

One can never consent to creep when one feels an impulse to soar

Oh Much may be done by defying The ghosts of Despair and Dismay And much may be gained by relying On Where theres a Will Theres a Way

We can never give up the belief that good guys always win And that we are the good guys

I know there will be spring as surely as the birds know it when they see above the snow two tiny quivering green leaves Spring cannot fail us

Most ball games are lost not won

Never face facts if you do youll never get up in the morning

Before you can win a game you have to not lose it

Football games arent won theyre lost

Success is a journey not a destination

The journey is my home

To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive and the true success is to labor

The man who goes fishing gets something more than the fish he catches

Despite the success cult men are most deeply moved not by the reaching of the goal but by the grandness of effort involved in getting thereor failing to get there

To live only for some future goal is shallow Its the sides of the mountain that sustain life not the top

The reward of the general is not a bigger tent but command

It is good to have an end to journey toward but it is the journey that matters in the end

Were still not where were going but were not where we were

Tis the motive exalts the action Tis the doing and not the deed

Arriving at one goal is the starting point to another

I think that wherever your journey takes you there are new gods waiting there with divine patienceand laughter

It has never been and never will be easy work But the road that is built in hope is more pleasant to the traveler than the road built in despair even though they both lead to the same destination

In the long run the pessimist may be proved to be right but the optimist has a better time on the trip

The excursion is the same when you go looking for your sorrow as when you go looking for your joy

The reward of a thing well done is to have done it

The struggle alone pleases us not the victory

The problem is not that you cannot have what you think you want The problem is that when you get what you think you want it wont satisfy

We should scarcely desire things ardently if we were perfectly acquainted with what we desire

With the catching ends the pleasures of the chase

To have realized your dream makes you feel lost

Need and struggle are what excite and inspire us our hour of triumph is what brings the void

We spend our time searching for security and hate it when we get it

Happiness is not a station to arrive at but a manner of traveling

Happiness is to be found along the way not at the end of the road for then the journey is over and it is too late

The really happy man is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour

You wear yourself out in the pursuit of wealth or love or freedom you do everything to gain some right and once its gained you take no pleasure in it

Success is counted sweetest by those who neer succeed

Granting our wish is one of Fates saddest jokes

Now that Im here where am I

Success is not greedy as people think but insignificant Thats why it satisfies nobody

Is there anything in life so disenchanting as attainment

Nothing fails like success nothing is so defeated as yesterdays triumphant cause

There are two tragedies in life One is to lose your hearts desire The other is to gain it

Success has ruined many a man

Fame always brings loneliness Success is as ice cold and lonely as the North Pole

Success has killed more men than bullets

Achievement The death of an endeavor and the birth of disgust

Success and failure are equally disastrous

The problems of victory are more agreeable than those of defeat but they are no less difficult

We are never further from our wishes than when we imagine that we possess what we have desired

Some aspects of success seem rather silly as death approaches

Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it the achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom

If I had known what it would be like to have it all I might have been willing to settle for less

Success and failure are both difficult to endure Along with success come drugs divorce fornication bullying travel meditation medication depression neurosis and suicide With failure comes failure

The two hardest things to handle in life are failure and success

The best thing that can come with success is the knowledge that it is nothing to long for

The closer one gets to the top the more one finds there is no top

Oh how quickly the worlds glory passes away

The minute you think youve got it made disaster is just around the corner

Creating success is tough But keeping it is tougher You have to keep producing you cant ever stop

Out of every fruition of success no matter what comes forth something to make a new effort necessary

The toughest thing about success is that youve got to keep on being a success Talent is only a starting point in business Youve got to keep working that talent

We would often be sorry if our wishes were gratified

Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won

Being frustrated is disagreeable but the real disasters of life begin when you get what you want

We grow weary of those things and perhaps soonest which we most desire

Our desires always increase with our possessions The knowledge that something remains yet unenjoyed impairs our enjoyment of the good before us

Oddly enough success over a period of time is more expensive than failure

There must be more to life than having everything

Its not that Im not grateful for all this attention Its just that fame and fortune ought to add up to more than fame and fortune

If you live long enough youll see that every victory turns into a defeat

One more such victory and we are undone

Pray that success will not come any faster than you are able to endure it

The prospect of success in achieving our most cherished dream is not without its terrors Who is more deprived and alone than the man who has achieved his dream

Success can also cause misery The trick is not to be surprised when you discover it doesnt bring you all the happiness and answers you thought it would

Adversity is sometimes hard upon a man but for one man who can stand prosperity there are a hundred that will stand adversity

To me success means effectiveness in the world that I am able to carry my ideas and values into the worldthat I am able to change it in positive ways

If you have a good name if you are right more often than you are wrong if your children respect you if your grandchildren are glad to see you if your friends can count on you and you can count on them in time of trouble if you can face your God and say I have done my best then you are a success

Success is getting what you want happiness is wanting what you get

Life is a succession of moments To live each one is to succeed

I personally measure success in terms of the contributions an individual makes to his or her fellow human beings

He has achieved success who has lived well laughed often and loved much who has gained the respect of intelligent men and the love of little children

Success has nothing to do with what you gain in life or accomplish for yourself Its what you do for others

If you have a good name if you are right more often than you are wrong if your children respect you if your grandchildren are glad to see you if your friends can count on you and you can count on them in time of trouble if you can face your God and say I have done my best then you are a success

Success is the sweetest revenge

You have reached the pinnacle of success as soon as you become uninterested in money compliments or publicity

A woman who is loved always has success

Success is not a doorway its a staircase

There is no scientific answer for success You cant define it Youve simply got to live it and do it

Marconi invented radio but Ted Husing knew what to do with it

The ultimate of being successful is the luxury of giving yourself the time to do what you want to do

I dont think success is harmful as so many people say Rather I believe it indispensible to talent if for nothing else than to increase the talent

Success produces success just as money produces money

If I do have some success Id like to enjoy it for heavens sake What is the point of having it otherwise

God may allow His servant to succeed when He has disciplined him to a point where he does not need to succeed to be happy The man who is elated by success and is cast down by failure is still a carnal man At best his fruit will have a worm in it

There is no business in the world so troublesome as the pursuit of fame life is over before you have hardly begun your work

Nothing fails like success because we dont learn from it We learn only from failure

The insight to see possible new paths the courage to try them the judgment to measure resultsthese are the qualities of a leader

Success makes men rigid and they tend to exalt stability over all the other virtues tired of the effort of willing they become fanatics about conservatism

Success is a great healer

All outward success when it has value is but the inevitable result of an inward success of full living full play and enjoyment of ones faculties

There are three types of baseball playersthose who make it happen those who watch it happen and those who wonder what happened

The exclusive worship of the bitchgoddess Success is our national disease

Success causes us to be more praised than known

Along with success comes a reputation for wisdom

Fame has only the span of the day they say But to live in the hearts of peoplethat is worth something

Great men have not been concerned with fame The joy of achievement that comes from finding something new in the universe is by far their greatest joy

Out of the strain of the Doing into the peace of the Done

Success is like a liberation or the first phase of a love affair

There is always room at the top

An act of love that fails is just as much a part of the divine life as an act of love that succeeds for love is measured by its own fullness not by its reception

The best place to succeed is where you are with what you have

Success covers a multitude of blunders

How to succeed try hard enough How to fail Try too hard

I have found that it is much easier to make a success in life than to make a success of ones life

There could be no honor in a sure success but much might be wrested from a sure defeat

Bad will be the day for every man when he becomes absolutely contented with the life he is living when there is not forever beating at the doors of his soul some great desire to do something larger

When there is no feeling of accomplishment children fail to develop properly and old people rapidly decline

Those who have easy cheerful attitudes tend to be happier than those with less pleasant temperaments regardless of money making it or success

Theirs is not to reason why theirs is but to do or die

Victory at all costs victory in spite of all terror victory however long and hard the hard may be for without victory there is no survival

In war there is no second prize for the runnerup

Success is simply a matter of luck Ask any failure

Success didnt spoil me Ive always been insufferable

When asked how long Ive worked here I replied since the day they threatened to fire me

He must really be a big success even his motherinlaw admits it

The only time you find success before work is in the dictionary

The haves and the havenots can often be traced back to the dids and the didnots

Behind every successful man is a woman with nothing to wear

Shes the kind of woman who climbed the ladder of success wrong by wrong

If at first you succeed dont take any more stupid chances

This guy put the suck in success

As soon as you find the key to success somebody always changes the lock

The penalty of success is to be bored by the people who used to snub you

Certainly I believe in luck How else do you explain the success of those you dont like

Behold the turtle He makes progress only when he sticks his neck out

If at first you dont succeed try try again Then quit Theres no use being a damn fool about it

A leading authority is anyone who has guessed right more than once

The nice thing about being a celebrity is that when you bore people they think its their fault

My formula for success is rise early work late and strike oil

Eagles may soar but weasels dont get sucked into jet engines

Sleep riches and health to be truly enjoyed must be interrupted

Sometimes the fool who rushes in gets the job done

Ive always wanted to be somebody but I see now I should have been more specific

Ideas are like rabbits You get a couple and learn how to handle them and pretty soon you have a dozen

Im a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work the more I have of it

Luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity

There is some consolation in the fact that even though your dreams dont come true neither do your nightmares

Success to me is having ten honeydew melons and eating only the top half of each one

If your ship doesnt come in swim out to it

Progress means taking risks for you cant steal home and keep your foot on third base

We cant all be heroes because someone has to sit on the curb and clap as they go by

If you lose youre going to be fired and if you win you only put off the day youre going to be fired

Success can make you go one of two ways It can make you a prima donna or it can smooth the edges take away the insecurities let the nice things come out

Successful minds work like a gimlet to a single point

All you need in this life is ignorance and confidence and then Success is sure

Success is counted sweetest By those who neer succeed

Nothing succeeds like success

There are but two ways of rising in the world either by ones own industry or profiting by the foolishness of others

I have always observed that to succeed in the world one should appear like a fool but be wise

Faith mighty faith the promise sees And looks to that alone Laughs at impossibilities And cries it shall be done

Either do not attempt at all or go through with it

To climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first

Somebodys said that it couldnt be done But he with a chuckle replied That maybe it couldnt but he would be one Who wouldnt say so till hed tried So he buckled right in with the trace of a grin On his face If he worried he hid it He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldnt be done and he did it

And he gave it for his opinion that whoever could make two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before would deserve better of mankind and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of politicians put together

I have trodden the winepress alone

It requires more courage to suffer than to die

No pain no palm no thorns no throne no gall no glory no cross no crown

We are healed of a suffering only by experiencing it to the full

I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us

I have a hundred times wished that one could resign life as an officer resigns a commission

It is cowardice to commit suicide

The relatives of a suicide always take it in bad part that he did not remain alive out of consideration for the family dignity

There is no refuge from confession but suicide and suicide is confession

One swallow alone does not make the summer

Oh the summer night Has a smile of light And she sits on a sapphire throne

Make hay while the sun shines

Whence are thy beams O sun thy everlasting light Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty the stars hide themselves in the sky the moon cold and pale sinks in the western wave But thou thyself movest alone

The sun shines even on the wicked

There are three marks of a superior man being virtuous he is free from anxiety being wise he is free from perplexity being brave he is free from fear

We can all perceive the difference between ourselves and our inferiors but when it comes to a question of the difference between us and our superiors we fail to appreciate merits of which we have no proper conceptions

Superiority is always detested

The general root of superstition is that men observe when things hit and not when they miss and commit to memory the one and forget and pass over the other

Superstition is the religion of feeble minds

I die adoring God loving my friends not hating my enemies and detesting superstition

Religion is not removed by removing superstition

There is in superstition a senseless fear of God

Suspicion is far more apt to be wrong than right oftener unjust than just It is no friend to virtue and always an enemy to happiness

As to Caesar when he was called upon he gave no testimony against Clodius nor did he affirm that he was certain of any injury done to his bed He only said He had divorced Pompeia because the wife of Caesar ought not only to be clear of such a crime but of the very suspicion of it

Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officer

The less we know the more we suspect

A woman of honor should not suspect another of things she would not do herself

All our geese are swans

You think that upon the score of foreknowledge and divining I am infinitely inferior to the swans When they perceive approaching death they sing more merrily than before because of the joy they have in going to the God they serve

The pursuit of the perfect then is the pursuit of sweetness and light

Every sweet hath its sour every evil its good

Sweet meat must have sour sauce

Sweets to the sweet

Of a truth men are mystically united a mystic bond of brotherhood makes all men one

The man who melts With social sympathy though not allied Is of more worth than a thousand kinsmen

He watchd and wept he prayd and felt for all

Never elated while one mans oppressd Never dejected while anothers blessd

Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep

No one really understands the grief or joy of another

A timid question will always receive a confident answer

Let us agree not to step on each others feet said the cock to the horse

If a person has no delicacy he has you in his power

Tact is the intelligence of the heart

Silence is not always tact and it is tact that is golden not silence

Diplomats are useful only in fair weather As soon as it rains they drown in every drop

A distinguished diplomat could hold his tongue in ten languages

Negotiation in the classic diplomatic sense assumes parties more anxious to agree than to disagree

Diplomacy the art of saying nice doggie till you can find a rock

If any pilgrim monk come from distant parts with wish as a guest to dwell in the monastery and will be content with the customs which he finds in the place and does not perchance by his lavishness disturb the monastery but is simply content with what he finds he shall be received for as long as he desires If indeed he find fault with anything or expose it reasonably and with the humility of charity the Abbott shall discuss it prudently lest perchance God had sent him for this very thing But if he have been found gossipy and contumacious in the time of his sojourn as guest not only ought he not be joined to the body of the monastery but also it shall be said to him honestly that he must depart If he does not go let two stout monks in the name of God explain the matter to him

An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country

Women and foxes being weak are distinguished by superior tact

Without tact you can learn nothing

To have the reputation of possessing the most perfect social tact talk to every woman as if you loved her and to every man as if he bored you

Beware of him that telleth tales

A schoolboys tale the wonder of an hour

Tush These are trifles and mere old wives tales

What so tedious as a twicetold tale

I cannot tell how the truth may be I say the tale as twas said to me

A tale never loses in the telling

I will a round unvarnishd tale deliver

All our talents increase in the using and every faculty both good and bad strengthens by exercise

Conciseness is the sister of talent

Genius does what it must and talent does what it can

In this world people have to pay an extortionate price for any exceptional gift whatever

There is no substitute for talent Industry and all the virtures are of no avail

Talent is always conscious of its own abundance and does not object to sharing

The luck of having talent is not enough one must also have a talent for luck

A talent somewhat above mediocrity shrewd and not too sensitive is more likely to rise in the world than genius which is apt to be perturbable and to wear itself out before fruition

Great talents are the most lovely and often the most dangerous fruits on the tree of humanity They hang upon the most slender twigs that are easily snapped off

Everyone has a talent What is rare is the courage to follow the talent to the dark places where it leads

The crowning blessing of life to be born with a bias to some pursuit

Concealed talent brings no reputation

The world is always ready to receive talent with open arms

The time has come the Walrus said To talk of many things Of shoes and ships and sealingwax Of cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings

But far more numerous was the herd of stfch Who think too little and who talk too much

Talk is cheap

In much of your talking thinking is half murdered

They never taste who always drink They always talk who never think

Talkers are no good doers

In general those who nothing have to say Contrive to spend the longest time in doing it

Those who have few things to attend to are great babblers for the less men think the more they talk

He who talks too much commits a sin

The secret of being tiresome is in telling everything

Everyone carries his own inchrule of taste and amuses himself by applying it triumphantly wherever he travels

Talking is like playing on the harp there is as much in laying the hand on the strings to stop their vibrations as in twanging them to bring out their music

Good taste is the first refuge of the noncreative It is the last ditch stand of the artist

It is good taste and good taste alone that possesses the power to sterilize and is always the first handicap to any creative functioning

Taste is the feminine of genius

Taste is the enemy of creativeness

Have nothing in your houses that you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful

Style is a simple way of saying complicated things

Fashion exists for women with no taste etiquette for people with no breeding

People care more about being thought to have good taste than about being thought either good clever or amiable

We all have some taste or other of too ancient a date to admit of our remembering that it was an acquired one

Good taste and humour are a contradiction in terms like a chaste whore

Taste cannot be controlled by law

One of the surest signs of the Philistine is his reverence for the superior tastes of those who put him down

One mans poison ivy is another mans spinach

Taste is nothing but a delicate good sense

Everyone to his taste

My tastes are aristocratic my actions democratic

A mans palate can in time become accustomed to anything

Good taste is the flower of good sense

The finer impulse of our nature

Every man as he loveth quoth the good man when he kissed the cow

The Eiffel Tower is the Empire State Building after taxes

The power to tax involves the power to destroy

The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to get the most feathers with the least hissing

The point to remember is that what the government gives it must first take away

Next to being shot at and missed nothing is quite as satisfying as an income tax refund

The income tax has made more liars out of the American people than golf has Even when you make a tax form out on the level you dont know when its through if you are a crook or a martyr

Governments last as long as the undertaxed can defend themselves against the overtaxed

There went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed And all went to be taxed everyone into his own city

The promises of yesterday are the taxes of today

The art of taxation consists in so plucking the goose as to obtain the largest amount of feathers with the least possible amount of hissing

Death and taxes are inevitable

First he wrought and afterwards he taught

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day Teach man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime

The school teacher is certainly underpaid as a child minder but ludicrously overpaid as an educator

There is no crisis to which academics will not respond with a seminar

A teacher affects eternity he can never tell where his influence stops

It would be a great advantage to some schoolmasters if they would steal two hours a day from their pupils and give their own minds the benefit of the robbery

If the student fails to learn the teacher fails to teach

To teach is to learn twice

The authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive hindrance to those who desire to learn

Teaching is not a lost art but the regard for it is a lost tradition

A highschool teacher after all is a person deputized by the rest of us to explain to the young what sort of world they are living in and to defend if possible the part their elders are playing in it

He who can does He who cant teaches

Nothing that is worth knowing can be taught

I hear and I forget I see and I remember I do and I understand

The secret of teaching is to appear to have known all your life what you learned this afternoon

No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of your knowledge

The first duty of a lecturer to hand you after an hours discourse a nugget of pure truth to wrap up between the pages of your notebooks and keep on the mantelpiece for ever

We teach what we need to learn and write what we need to know

You cannot teach old dogs new tricks

A man should first direct himself in the way he should go Only then should he instruct others

You cannot teach a man anything you can only help him to find it within himself

A teacher who is attempting to teach without inspiring the pupil with a desire to learn is hammering on cold iron

Speak to the earth and it shall teach thee

Public instruction should be the first object of government

Everybody who is incapable of learning has taken to teaching

Tears are Summer showers to the soul

For Beautys tears are lovelier than her smile

Words that weep and tears that speak

Never a tear bedims the eye That time and patience will not dry

Oh would I were dead now Or up in my bed now To cover my head now And have a good cry

If the man who turnips cries Cry not when his father dies Tis proof that he had rather Have a turnip than his father

There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth

It is some relief to weep grief is satisfied and carried off by tears

If you have tears prepare to shed them now

Tears are the silent language of grief

All television is educational television The question is what is it teaching

He who prides himself on giving what he thinks the public wants is often creating a fictitious demand for low standards which he will then satisfy

Of all the dramatic media radio is the most visual

Television The word is half Latin and half Greek No good can come of it

Televisions compelling power is its immediacy this immediacy feeds the politics of emotions gut reactions and impressions rather than the politics of logic facts and reason it emphasizes personality rather than issues

Television is the literature of the illiterate the culture of the lowbrow the wealth of the poor the privilege of the underprivileged the exclusive club of the excluded masses

I can get a better grasp of what is going on in the world from one good Washington dinner party than from all the background information NBC piles on my desk

When television is good nothing is better But when television is bad nothing is worse I invite you to sit down in front of your TV set and keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland

Television has proved that people will look at anything rather than each other

Television is a gold goose that lays scrambled eggs and it is futile and probably fatal to beat it for not laying caviar

Television is chewing gum for the eyes

In the age of television image becomes more important than substance

Television is the first truly democratic culture the first culture available to everybody and entirely governed by what the people want The most terrifying thing is what people do want

Television has a real problem They have no page two

Good heavens television is something you appear on you dont watch

Television is an invention that permits you to be entertained in your living room by people you wouldnt have in your home

Why should people pay good money to go out and see bad films when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing

The television commercial is the most efficient powerpacked capsule of education that appears anywhere on TV

Television is not the truth Television is a goddamned amusement park Television is a circus a carnival a travelling troupe of acrobats storytellers dancers singers jugglers sideshow freaks lion tamers and football players Were in the boredomkilling business

Dictum on television scripts We dont want it good we want it Tuesday

Ive had several years in Hollywood and I still think the movie heroes are in the audience

The first draught serveth for health the second for pleasure the third for shame and the fourth for madness

Every moderate drinker could abandon the intoxicating cup if he would every inebriate would if he could

Drinking water neither makes a man sick nor in debt nor his wife a widow

The smaller the drink the clearer the head and the cooler the blood

All men are tempted There is no man that lives that cant be broken down provided it is the right temptation put in the right spot

There are several good protections against temptation but the surest is cowardice

Temptation rarely comes in working hours It is in their leisure time that men are made or marred

Things forbidden have a secret charm

After listening to thousands of pleas for pardon to offenders I can hardly recall a case where I did not feel that I might have fallen as my fellow man had done if I had been subjected to the same demoralizing influences and pressed by the same temptations

I have a simple principle for the conduct of life never to resist an adequate temptation

If the world were merely seductive that would be easy If it were merely challenging that would be no problem But I rise in the morning torn between a desire to improve or save the world and a desire to enjoy or savour the world This makes it hard to plan the day

The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it Resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself

Never give in never give in never never never never in nothing great or small large or petty never give in except to convictions of honour and good sense

I generally avoid temptation unless I cant resist it

Blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life

Honest bread is very well its the butter that makes the temptation

Get thee behind me Satan

Never resist temptation prove all things hold fast that which is good

I can resist everything except temptation

One thing I can guarantee you You may not be a great deal wiser from my talk today but you will be a great deal older

I want to thank everybody who made this day necessary

I really dont deserve this but I have arthritis and I dont deserve that either

I explained to him I had simple tastes and didnt want anything ostentatious no matter what it costs

I feel a very unusual sensation if it is not indigestion I think it must be gratitude

I forgot they were talking about me They sound so wonderfully convincing

Ive always been well liked I was so popular in school everybody hated me

The audience was swell They were so polite they covered their mouths when they yawned

Ive been here so long when I got here the Dead Sea wasnt even sick yet

A closed mouth gathers no foot

Some people speak from experience while others from experience dont speak

The best way to save face is keep the bottom half shut

It is almost impossible to find those who admire us entirely lacking in taste

Admiration Our polite recognition of another mans resemblance to ourselves

A good storyteller is a person who has a good memory and hopes other people havent

Adam was the only man who when he said a good thing knew that nobody had said it before him

The trouble with most of us is that we would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism

Dont worry if your you is small and your rewards are few Remember that the mighty oak was once a nut like you

A sense of humor is what makes you laugh at something that would make you mad if it happened to you

If Noah found himself back on Earth you can bet all he would recognize would be the jokes

A sense of humor is the ability to laugh at your own jokes when your friends tell them

The trouble with eating Italian food is that five or six days later youre hungry again

Nouvelle cuisine roughly translated means I cant believe I spent ninetysix dollars and Im still hungry

Ive had a wonderful evening but this wasnt it

A conclusion is the place where you got tired of thinking

There are no perfect people except of course my wifes first husband

Ladies and gentlemen you cant please everyone Take my girlfriend I think shes the most remarkable woman in the world Thats me But to my wife

I love a finished speaker I really truly do I dont mean one whos polished I just mean one whos through

Remember if God had wanted this to be perfect he never would have had me up here

It is always dullest before the yawn

I noticed you werent checking your watches youve been shaking them

Id like to thank the committee that brought this event about It was an equal endeavor They did the food decorations and reservations and I did the traffic flow

Better to be king for a night than a schmuck for a lifetime

Heres to one of the most beautiful kind thoughtful people I have ever known You are getting more like me every day

Another fine mess youve got us in Stanley

He who laughs last thinks slowest

Lets face it some days youre the pigeon and some days youre the statue

If there is anyone here whom I have not insulted I beg his pardon

Dont move I want to forget you just the way you are

I thank you for not snoring

O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever

Beggar that I am I am even poor in thanks

How sharper than a serpents tooth it is To have a thankless child

Heap high the board with plenteous cheer and gather to the feast And toast the sturdy Pilgrim band whose courage never ceased Give praise to that AllGracious One by whom their steps were led And thanks unto the harvests Lord who sends our daily bread

Brotherton So once in every year we throng Upon a day apart To praise the Lord with feast and song In thankfulness of heart

Fear is the denomination of the Old Testament belief is the denomination of the New

The English of the Bible has a pithiness and raciness a homely tang a terse sententiousness an idiomatic flavour which comes home to mens business and bosoms a nobility of diction and a rhythmic quality unrivaled in its beauty

The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world

That kind of socalled housekeeping where they have six Bibles and no corkscrew

The total absence of humour in the Bible is one of the most singular things in all literature

The Old and New Testaments are the Great Code of Art

The fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge

I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith

I am fearfully and wonderfully made

The whole head is sick and the whole heart faint

It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house

Oh my Father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou wilt

A prophet is not without honour save in his own country

Be not curious in unnecessary matters for more things are shewed unto thee than men understand

Seek not out the things that are too hard for thee neither search the things that are above thy strength

How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace

His countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow

Ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you

Be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap

Watchman what of the night

Man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets

The letter killeth but the spirit giveth life

For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle

Borne the burden and heat of the day

The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose

Entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God where thou diest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me

We have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept

I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or hot

They are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away

Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house

Bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman

When caught reading the Bible WC Fields said Tm looking for loopholes The Bible is nothing but a succession of civil rights struggles by the Jewish people against their oppressors

Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength

Unto everyone that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath

He that is not with me is against me

Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward

For what is your life It is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away

My days are swifter than a weavers shuttle

I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart

The bible should be taught so early and so thoroughly that it sinks straight to the bottom of the mind where everything that comes along can settle on it

A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one

A hick town is one in which there is no place to go where you shouldnt be

City life millions of people being lonesome together

We might define an eccentric as a man who is law unto himself and a crank as one who having determined what the law is insists on laying it down to others

The country has charms only for those not obliged to stay there

A great city a great solitude

In small settlements everyone knows your affairs In the big city everyone does not only those you choose to tell will know about you This is one of the attributes of cities that is precious to most city people

If you would be known and not know vegetate in a village if you would know and not be known live in a city

Farmers worry only during the growing season but town people worry all the time

What is the city but the people

As a remedy to life in society I would suggest the big city Nowadays it is the only desert within our reach

All cities are mad but the madness is gallant All cities are beautiful but the beauty is grim

The chicken is the countrys but the city eats it

Cities force growth and make men talkative and entertaining but they make them artificial

The city is a cultural invention enforcing on the citizen knowledge of his own nature And this we do not like That we are aggressive beings easily given to violence that we get along together because we must more than because we want to and that the brotherhood of man is about as far from reality today as it was two thousand years ago that reasons realm is small that we never have been and never shall be created equal that if the human being is perfectible he has so far exhibited few symptoms all are considerations of man from which space tends to protect us

There is nothing good to be had in the country or if there be they will not let you have it

Anybody can be good in the country There are no temptations there

The axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of each and every town or city

To say the least a town life makes one more tolerant and liberal in ones judgement of others

Commuters give the city its tidal restlessness natives give it solidity and continuity but the settlers give it passion

Summertime oh summertime pattern of life indelible the fadeproof lake the woods unshatterable the pasture with the sweetfern and the juniper forever and ever the cottages with their innocent and tranquil design their tiny docks with the flagpole and the American flag floating against the white clouds in the blue sky the little paths over the roots of the trees leading from camp to camp This was the American family at play escaping the city heat

There is no solitude in the world like that of the big city

Upper classes are a nations past the middleclass is its future

People are afraid of the future of the unknown If a man faces up to it and takes the dare of the future he can have some control over his destiny Thats an exciting idea to me better than waiting with everybody else to see whats going to happen

Tomorrow is the most important thing in life Comes in to us at midnight very clean Its perfect when it arrives and it puts itself in our hands and hopes weve learnt something from yesterday

Nothing in the world can one imagine beforehand not the least thing Everything is made up of so many unique particulars that cannot be foreseen

You can never plan the future by the past

One must care about a world one will not see

If you can look into the seeds of time and say which grain will grow and which will not speak then to me

The future is something which every one reaches at the rate of sixty miles an hour whatever he does whoever he is

My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there

Tomorrow is a satire on today And shows its weakness

The future comes one day at a time

Never let the future disturb you You will meet it if you have to with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present

What we look for does not come to pass God finds a way for what none foresaw

With high hope for the future no prediction is ventured

We can pay our debt to the past by putting the future in debt to ourselves

The future is not a gift it is an achievement

The world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is in fact a return to the idealized past

That which is escaped now is pain to come

Light tomorrow with today

If tomorrow were never to come it would not be worth living today

The afternoon knows what the morning never suspected

The future is purchased by the present

Life is an irreversible process and for that reason its future can never be a repetition of the past

I believe the future is only the past again entered through another gate

The world will be saved by one or two people

It is a mistake to look too far ahead Only one link in the chain of destiny can be handled at a time

It is seldom in life that one knows that a coming event is to be of crucial importance

Neither in the life of the individual nor in that of mankind is it desirable to know the future

There is only one large circle that we march in around and around each of us with our own little picturein front of usour own little mirage that we think is the future

God made the world round so we would never be able to see too far down the road

The future comes one day at a time

There is a case and a strong case for that particular form of indolence that allows us to move through life knowing only what immediately concerns us

Cease to inquire what the future has in store and take as a gift whatever the day brings forth

There is no data on the future

The best thing about the future is that it comes only one day at a time

Hardly anyone knows how much is gained by ignoring the future

The future is hidden even from those who make it

They who lose today may win tomorrow

Be of good cheer Do not think of todays failures but of the success that may come tomorrow You have set yourselves a difficult task but you will succeed if you persevere and you will find a joy in overcoming obstacles Remember no effort that we make to attain something beautiful is ever lost

When all else is lost the future still remains

There is hope for all of us Well anyway if you dont die you live through it day in day out

Our faith in the present dies out long before our faith in the future

I have been nothing but there is tomorrow

After all tomorrow is another day

Everyone has it within his power to say this I am today that I shall be tomorrow

He who foresees calamities suffers them twice over

Only man clogs his happiness with care destroying what is with thoughts of what may be

It is never safe to look into the future with eyes of fear

If you are afraid for your future you dont have a present

He that fears not the future may enjoy the present

Cowards die many times before their deaths the valiant never taste of death but once

The future is called perhaps which is the only possible thing to call the future And the important thing is not to allow that to scare you

To relinquish a present good through apprehension of a future evil is in most instances unwise from a fear which may afterwards turn out groundless you lost the good that lay within your grasp

Nothing in life is more remarkable than the unnecessary anxiety which we endure and generally create ourselves

Every man through fear mugs his aspirations a dozen times a day

The mere apprehension of a coming evil has put many into a situation of the utmost danger

We need not be afraid of the future for the future will be in our own hands

I am not afraid of tomorrow for I have seen yesterday and I love today

Go forth to meet the shadowy Future without fear and with a manly heart

We grow in time to trust the future for our answers

Every tomorrow has two handles We can take hold of it with the handle of anxiety or the handle of faith

Put aside the need to know some future design and simply leave your life open to what is needed of it by the Divine forces

See how time makes all grief decay

The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today Let us move forward with strong and active faith

It is not the cares of today but the cares of tomorrow that weigh a man down For the needs of today we have corresponding strength given For the morrow we are told to trust It is not ours yet

Take therefore no thought of the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself

Tomorrow is the day when idlers work and fools reform and mortal men lay hold on heaven

Tomorrow is the mysterious unknown guest

Tomorrow is the only day in the year that appeals to a lazy man

The future is something which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is

The future is a world limited by ourselvesin it we discover only what concerns us

The future is only the past again entered through another gate

The future is the most expensive luxury in the world

The future is the shape of things to come

The future is the past in preparation

To the being of fully alive the future is not ominous but a promise it surrounds the present like a halo

The future is hope

The future is a great land

The future is wider than vision and has no end

Losing the future is the best thing that ever happened to me

Grow old along with me The best is yet to be

I have always been driven by some distant musica battle hymn no doubtfor I have been at war from the beginning Ive never looked back before Ive never had the time and it has always seemed so dangerous

He who lives in the future lives in a featureless blank he lives in impersonality he lives in Nirvana The past is democratic because it is a people The future is despotic because it is a caprice Every man is alone in his prediction just as each man is alone in a dream

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams

When I look to the future its so bright it burns my eyes

I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past

I never think of the future It comes soon enough

You cannot plan the future by the past

It is when tomorrows burden is added to the burden of today that the weight is more than a man can bear

My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there

Yesterday is not ours to recover but tomorrow is ours to win or lose

The possibilities for tomorrow are usually beyond our expectations

Where will I be five years from now I delight in not knowing Thats one of the greatest things about lifeits wonderful surprises

When I look at the future its so bright it burns my eyes

Everyones future is in reality uncertain and full of unknown treasures from which all may draw unguessed prizes

The future is made of the same stuff as the present

The future is much like the present only longer

Byandby never comes

The bridges you cross before you come to them are over rivers that arent there

Strike when thou wilt the hour of rest but let my last days be my best

For you and me today is all we have tomorrow is a mirage that may never become reality

I fear there will be no future for those who do not change

If a man carefully examines his thoughts he will be surprised to find how much he lives in the future His wellbeing is always ahead

I got the blues thinking of the future so I left off and made some marmalade Its amazing how it cheers one up to shred oranges and scrub the floor

You learn to build your roads on today because tomorrows ground is too uncertain for plans and futures have a way of falling down in midflight

Fortunately for children the uncertainties of the present always give way to the enchanted possibilities of the future

A house may draw visitors but it is the possessor alone that can detain them

A mans home is his wifes castle

I want a house that has got over all its troubles I dont want to spend the rest of my life bringing up a young and inexperienced house

The great advantage of a hotel is that its a refuge from home life

The surroundings householders crave are glorified autobiographies

Home is not where you live but where they understand you

Where thou art that is Home

Home is the place where when you have to go there They have to take you in

A man builds a fine house and now he has a master and a task for life is to furnish watch show it and keep it in repair the rest of his life

The strength of a nation especially of a republican nation is in the intelligent and wellordered homes of the people

Justice was born outside the home and a long way from it and it has never been adopted there

The home of everyone is to him his castle and fortress as well for his defence against injury and violence as for his repose

Pride avarice and envy are in every home

Of all modern notions the worst is this that domesticity is dull Inside the home they say is dead decorum and routine outside is adventure and variety But the truth is that the home is the only place of liberty the only spot on earth where a man can alter arrangements suddenly make an experiment or indulge in a whim The home is not the one tame place in a world of adventure it is the one wild place in a world of rules and set tasks

I have come back again to where I belong not an enchanted place but the walls are strong

To mankind in general Macbeth and Lady Macbeth stand out as the supreme type of all that a host and hostess should not be

The fellow that owns his own home is always just coming out of a hardware store

Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age 18

Curiosity is a lust of the mind

Gluttony is an emotional escape a sign something is eating us

The heart of a statesman should be in his head

Minds like bodies will often fall into a pimpled illconditioned state from mere excess of comfort

Of course he seems to have quite a mind of his own and that is probably where he is weakest

That is the consolation of a little mind you have the fun of changing it without impeding the progress of mankind

The flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind those of the past and future as well as the present

The mind of man is capable of anything because everything is in it all the past as well as all the future

Then comes Winston with his hundred horsepower mind and what can I do

We know the human brain is a device to keep the ears from grating on one another

One man who has a mind and knows it can always beat ten men who havent and dont

When the mind is thinking it is talking to itself

I am not absentminded It is the presence of mind that makes me unaware of everything else

Our unconsciousness is like a vast subterranean factory with intricate machinery that is never idle where work goes on day and night from the time we are born until the moment of our death

Only an incompetent mind is content to express itself incompetently

A great many open minds should be closed for repairs

If you keep your mind sufficiently open people will throw a lot of rubbish into it

Merely having an open mind is nothing The object of opening the mind as of opening the mouth is to shut it again on something solid

The perversion of the mind is only possible when those who should be heard in its defence are silent

Our minds are lazier than our bodies

Strength is a matter of the madeup mind

What we think and feel and are is to a great extent determined by the state of our ductless glands and our viscera

The feeling of inferiority rules the mental life and can be clearly recognized as the sense of incompleteness and unfulfillment and in the uninterrupted struggle both of individuals and of humanity

Discipline does not mean suppression and control nor is it adjustment to a pattern or ideology It means a mind that sees what is and learns from what was

That which enters the mind through reason can be corrected That which is admitted through faith hardly ever

Vanity plays lurid tricks with our memory

Nostalgia is a seductive liar

Was it always my nature to take a bad time and block out the good times until any success became an accident and failure seemed the only truth

Nostalgia A device that removes the ruts and potholes from memory lane

What was hard to bear is sweet to remember

The hearts memory eliminates the bad and magnifies the good and thanks to this artifice we manage to endure the burdens of the past

Some folks never exaggeratethey just remember big

A mans memory may almost become the art of continually varying and misrepresenting his past according to his interest in the present

Praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear

God gave us memory that we might have roses in December

There has never been an age that did not applaud the past and lament the present

Only sick music makes money today

Children today are tyrants They contradict their parents gobble their food and tyrannize their teachers

Posterity will say as usual In the past things were better the present is worse than the past

Our ignorance of history makes us libel to our own times People have always been like this

Oh this age How tasteless and illbred it is

This strange disease of modern life with its sick hurry its divided aims

The illusion that times that were are better than those that are has probably pervaded all ages

Oh what times Oh what standards

Probably no one alive hasnt at one time or another brooded over the possibility of going back to an earlier ideal age in his existence and living a different kind of life

The Golden Age was never the present Age

The worst time is always the present

The good old timesall times when old are good

The good old days The only good days are ahead

There are two kinds of stones as everyone knows one which rolls

Recognizing what we have done in the past is a recognition of ourselves By conducting a dialogue with our past we are searching how to go forward

I know of no way of judging the future but by the past

Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it

To look backward for a while is to refresh the eye to restore it and to render it more fit for its prime function of looking forward

The past is never deadit is not even past

The past is the best way to suppose what may come

We can never go back again that much is certain The past is still too close to us The things we have tried to forget and put behind us would stir again and that sense of fear of furtive unrest might in some manner unforeseen become a living companion as it had before

Past Our cradle not our prison and there is danger as well as appeal in its glamour The past is for inspiration not imitation for continuation not repetition

Life can only be understood backwards but it must be lived forward

When I want to understand what is happening today or try to decide what will happen tomorrow I look back

We live in the present we dream of the future but we learn eternal truths from the past

The past is the best prophet of the future

Truth however bitter can be accepted and woven into a design for living

The past will not tell us what we ought to do but what we ought to avoid

Tomorrow hopes we have learned something from yesterday

Judgement comes from experience and great judgement comes from bad experience

The only use of a knowledge of the past is to equip us for the present

When the past has taught us that we have more within us than we have ever used our prayer is a cry to the divine to come to us and fill us with its power

Dont ruin the present with the ruined past

Ah tell me not that memory Sheds gladness oer the past What is recalled by faded flowers Save that they did not last

Here lies my past Goodbye I have kissed it Thank you kids I wouldnt have missed it

Forget the past and live the present hour

Living in the past is a dull and lonely business looking back strains the neck muscles causes you to bump into people not going your way

I demolish my bridges behind me then there is no choice but forward

Looking repeatedly into the past you do not necessarily become fascinated with your own life but rather with the phenomenon of memory

Let the past drift away with the water

The past cannot be changed The future is yet in your power

I have very strong feelings about how you lead your life You always look ahead you never look back

Not the power to remember but its very opposite the power to forget is a necessary condition for our existence

You cannot step twice into the same river for other waters are continually flowing on

Better by far you should forget and smile than that you should remember and be sad

The past should be culled like a box of fresh strawberries rinsed of debris sweetened judiciously and served in small portions not very often

May I forget what ought to be forgotten and recall unfailing all that ought to be recalled each kindly thing forgetting what might sting

Heres to the past Thank God its past

One must be thrust out of a finished cycle in life and that leap is the most difficult to maketo part with ones faith ones love when one would prefer to renew the faith and recreate the passion

The biggest thing in todays sorrow is the memory of yesterdays joy

Its but little good youll go awatering the last years crop

The worst thing you can do is to try to cling to something thats gone or to recreate it

Neer look for the birds of this year in the nests of the last

Dont look back Something may be gaining on you

Anyone who limits her vision to memories of yesterday is already dead

I like the dreams for the future better than the history of the past

The first recipe for happiness is Avoid too lengthy meditations on the past

The past is a funeral gone by

Never let yesterday use up today

How the past perishes is how the future becomes

The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present

In the life of the spirit there is no ending that is not a beginning

The past is but the beginning of a beginning and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn

Anyone who limits her vision to memories of yesterday is already dead

Nor deem the irrevocable Past As wholly wasted wholly vain If rising on its wrecks at last To something nobler we attain

Youth is after all just a moment but it is the moment the spark that you always carry in your heart

Nothing is predestined The obstacles of your past can become the gateways that lead to new beginnings

No star is ever lost we once have seen We always may be what we might have been

Whats past is prologue

In my end is my beginning

The good old days were never that good believe me The good new days are today and better days are coming tomorrow Our greatest songs are still unsung

The past is never completely lost khowever extensive the devastation Your sorrows are the bricks and mortar of a magnificent temple What you are today and what you will be tomorrow are because of what you have been

Fear not for the future weep not for the past

There are two days about which nobody should ever worry and these are yesterday and tomorrow

We crucify ourselves between two thieves regret for yesterday and fear of tomorrow

Every saint has a past and every sinner has a future

When I am anxious it is because I am living in the future When I am depressed it is because I am living in the past

Im not convinced that the world is in any worse shape than it ever was Its just that in this age of almost instantaneous communication we bear the weight of problems our forefathers only read about after they were solved

Truth has no beginning

The worlds history is constant like the laws of nature and simple like the souls of men

These are the stories that never never die that are carried like seed into a new country are told to you and me and make in us new and lasting strengths

What one loves in childhood stays in the heart forever

This time like all times is a very good one if we but know what to do with it

In times like these it helps to recall that there have always been times like these

Our ignorance of history makes us libel our own times People have always been like this

The good old days are neither better nor worse than the ones were living through right now

Where I was born and where and how I have lived is unimportant It is what I have done with where I have been that should be of interest

Respect the past in the full measure of its deserts but do not make the mistake of confusing it with the present nor seek in it the ideals of the future

Its a pleasure to share ones memories Everything remembered is dear endearing touching precious At least the past is safethough we didnt know it at the time We know it now Because its in the past because we have survived

The events in our lives happen in a sequence in time but in their significance to ourselves they find their own order the continuous thread of revelation

The best compliment we can pay our past is to prophetically and bravely face today and tomorrow

Some memories are realities and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again

Fortunate are the people whose roots are deep

As the dew to the blossom the bud to the bee As the scent to the rose are those memories to me

Heirlooms we dont have in our family But stories weve got

We have to do with the past only as we can make it useful to the present and the future

The past is a guidepost not a hitching post

The past in retrospect holds manifold disenchantments failures and even tragedies and yet the worse may be forgotten and the best held fast

The road was new to me as roads always are going back

No yesterdays are ever wasted for those who give themselves to today

Yesterday I lived today I suffer tomorrow I die but I still think fondly today and tomorrow of yesterday

Each has his past shut in him like the leaves of a book shown to him by heart and his friends can only read the title

We are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget

The past is a work of art free of irrelevancies and loose ends

The past is a foreign country they do things differently there

The past with its pleasures its rewards its foolishness its punishments is there for each of us forever and it should be

The past is that which we possess fully and in whole

Our deeds still travel with us from afar and what we have been makes us what we are

The past is the tomorrow that got away

Our life is like some vast lake that is slowly filling with the stream of our years As the waters creep surely upward the landmarks of the past are one by one submerged But there shall always be memory to lift its head above the tide until the lake is overflowing

Why should we grope among the dry bones of the past or put the living generation into masquerade out of its faded wardrobe

No past is dead for us but only sleeping love

I look back on my life like a good days work it is done and I am satisfied with it

Of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these It might have been

That sign of old age extolling the past at the expense of the present

The past is one evil less and one memory more

Then is then Now is now We must grow to learn the difference

The past not merely is not fugitive it remains present

The past which is so presumptuously brought forward as a precedent for the present was itself founded on some past that went before it

Old times never come back and I suppose its just as well What comes back is a new morning every day in the year and thats better

We have inherited new difficulties because we have inherited more privileges

People are always asking about the good old days I say why dont you say the good now days Isnt now the only time youre living

Life in the twentieth century undeniably has such richness joy and adventure as were unknown to our ancestors except in their dreams

Enjoy yourself These are the good old days youre going to miss in the years ahead

The past is our very being

To disdain today is to prove that yesterday has been misunderstood

The universe is made of stories not of atoms

This is not a dress rehearsal This is It

Only when your consciousness is totally focused on the moment you are in can you receive whatever gift esson or delight that moment has to

Seize the day and put the least possible trust in tomorrow

Tomorrows life is too late Live today

One today is worth two tomorrows

Half of today is better than all of tomorrow

Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today because if you enjoy it today you can do it again tomorrow

Today is the first day of the rest of your life

The present moment is significant not as the bridge between past and future but by reason of its contents which can fill our emptiness and become ours if we are capable of receiving them

All of us tend to put off living We are all dreaming of some magical rose garden over the horizon instead of enjoying the roses that are blooming outside our windows today

Its not that today is the first day of the rest of my life but that now is all there is of my life

We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers damn is the history we make today

Now is the only time we own give love toil with a will And place no faith in tomorrow for the clock may then be still

Enjoy yourself drink call the life you live today your ownbut only that the rest belongs to chance

You are younger today than you ever will be again Make use of it for the sake of tomorrow

If we are ever to enjoy life now is the time not tomorrow or next year Today should always be our most wonderful day

Live now believe me wait not till tomorrow gather the roses of life today

So often we rob tomorrows memories by todays economies

You had better live your best and act your best and think your best today for today is the sure preparation for tomorrow and all the other tomorrows that follow

Happy the man and happy he alone He can call today his own He who secure within can say Tomorrow do thy worst for I have lived today

Forget mistakes Forget failures Forget everything except what youre going to do now and do it Today is your lucky day

Yesterday is ashes tomorrow wood Only today does the fire burn brightly

One of these days is none of these days

This is the day which the Lord has made Let us rejoice and be glad in it

He growled at morning noon and night And trouble sought to borrow Although today the sky was bright He knew twould storm tomorrow A thought of joy he could not stand And struggled to resist it Though sunshine dappled all the land This sorry pessimist it

To those leaning on the sustaining infinite today is big with blessings

The hereandnow is no mere filling of time but a filling of time with God

In the present every day is a miracle

Life is only this place this time and these people right here and now

I believe that only one person in a thousand knows the trick of really living in the present

There is one thing we can do and the happiest people are those who do it to the limit of their ability We can be completely present We can be all here We can give all our attention to the opportunity before us

The more I give myself permission to live in the moment and enjoy it without feeling guilty or judgmental about any other time the better I feel about the quality of my work

Actact in the living Present

Are not my days few Cease then and let me alone that I may take comfort a little Before I go to the place from which I shall not return

Now or never was the time

And now Lord what wait I for

The future belongs to those who live intensely in the present

The present is elastic to embrace infinity

The present is the living sumtotal of the whole past

The present is an eternal now

The present is all the ready money Fate can give

The present is an edifice which God cannot rebuild

The present is the blocks with which we build

The present is the symbol and vehicle of the future

The present is all you have for your certain possession

We are here and it is now Further than that all knowledge is moonshine

Having spent the better part of my life trying either to relive the past or experience the future before it arrives I have come to believe that in between these two extremes is peace

This time like all times is a very good one if we but know what to do with it

The time is always right to do what is right

One realm we have never conquered the pure present

He who lives in the present lives in eternity

I am in the present I cannot know what tomorrow will bring forth I can know only what the truth is for me today That is what I am called upon to serve

The present offers itself to our touch for only an instant of time and then eludes the senses

A life uncommanded now is uncommanded a life unenjoyed now is unenjoyed a life not lived wisely now is not lived wisely

The word now is like a bomb thrown through the window and it ticks

Whether its the best of times or the worst of times its the only time weve got

It is now and in this world that we must live

Who cares about great marks left behind We have one life Just one Our life We have nothing else

Thisthe immediate everyday and present experienceis IT the entire and ultimate point for the existence of a universe

Let us live today

Work accomplished means little It is in the past What we all want is the glorious and living present

Yesterday is a cancelled check Tomorrow is a promissory note Today is cash in hand Spend It

Today Relative to Yesterday or Tomorrow The future is made of the same stuff as the present

Yesterday is but a dream tomorrow is only a vision But today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow a vision of hope Look well therefore to this day for it is life the very life of life

Be glad today Tomorrow may bring tears Be brave today The darkest night will pass And golden rays will usher in the dawn

Do not look back on happiness or dream of it in the future You are only sure of today do not let yourself be cheated out of it

Existence is no more than the precarious attainment of relevance in an intensely mobile flux of past present and future

I am not afraid of tomorrow for I have seen yesterday and I love today

The past the present and the future are really one they are today

The present contains all that there is It is holy ground for it is the past and it is the future

There is no justification for present existence other than its expansion into an indefinitely open future

With the past I have nothing to do nor with the future I live now

Children have neither a past nor a future Thus they enjoy the present which seldom happens to us

The past is a bucket of ashes so live not in your yesterdays nor just for tomorrow but in the here and now

Youth is the time of getting middle age of improving and old age of spending

It is not the weight of the future or the past that is pressing upon you but ever that of the present alone Even this burden too can be lessened if you confine it strictly to its own limits

Reappraise the past reevaluate where weve been clarify where we are and predict or anticipate where we are headed

We can easily manage if we will only take each day the burden appointed to it But the load will be too heavy for us if we carry yesterdays burden over again today and then add the burden of the morrow before we are required to bear it

Take in the ideas of the day drain off those of yesterday As to the morrow time enough to consider it when it becomes today

Tomorrow I will live the fool does say today itselfs too late the wise lived yesterday

The cares of today are seldom those of tomorrow

Yesterday is a cancelled check tomorrow is a promissory note today is the only cash you haveso spend it wisely

Everymans life lies within the present for the past is spent and done with and the future is uncertain

The flesh endures the storms of the present alone the mind those of the past and future as well

I try to learn from the past but I plan for the future by focusing exclusively on the present Thats where the fun is

No mind is much employed upon the present recollection and anticipation fill up almost all our moments

The only living life is in the past and futurethe present is an interlude strange interlude in which we call on past and future to bear witness that we are living

Past and to come seems best things present worst

The past cannot be regained although we can learn from it the future is not yet ours even though we must plan for it Time is now We have only today

Look not mournfully into the past it comes not back again Wisely improve the present it is thine Go forth to meet the shadowy future without fear and with a manly heart

No longer forward nor behind I look in hope or fear but grateful take the good I find the best of now and here

The present like a note in music is nothing but as it appertains to what is past and what is to come

We can see well into the past we can guess shrewdly in to the future but that which is rolled up and muffled in impenetrable folds is today

The present time is seldom able to fill desire or imagination with immediate enjoyment and we are forced to supply its deficiencies by recollection or anticipation

Be satisfied and pleased with what thou art Act cheerfully and well thy allotted part Enjoy the present hour be thankful for the past And neither fear nor wish the approaches of the last

It is difficult to live in the present ridiculous to live in the future and impossible to live in the past

If you have one eye on yesterday and one eye on tomorrow youre going to be cockeyed today

Yesterday has gone Tomorrow may never come There is only the miracle of this moment Savor it It is a gift

Dont waste today regretting yesterday instead of making a memory for tomorrow

Light tomorrow with today

I just take one day Yesterday is gone Tomorrow has not come We have only today to love Jesus

Patterns of the past echo in the present and resound through the future

Who controls the past controls the future who controls the present controls the past

If we spend our time with regrets over yesterday and worries over what might happen tomorrow we have no today in which to live

Now is all we have Everything that has ever happened to you and anything that is ever going to happen to you is just a thought

The present is the necessary product of all the past the necessary cause of all the future

If we open a quarrel between the past and the present we shall find we have lost the future

Few of us ever live in the present we are forever anticipating what is to come or remembering what has gone

The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past not to worry about the future nor to anticipate troubles but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly

When we have a world of only now with no shadows of yesterdays or clouds of tomorrow then saying what we can do will work

I can feel guilty about the past apprehensive about the future but only in the present can I act The ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness

I have realized that the past and the future are real illusions that they exist only in the present which is what there is and all that there is

There is no present or future only the past happening over and over again now

Today was once the future from which you expected so much in the past

Today is yesterdays pupil

Today is yesterdays effect and tomorrows cause

Through loyalty to the past our mind refuses to realize that tomorrows joy is possible only if todays makes way for it that each wave owes the beauty of its line only to the withdrawal of the preceding one

The present is the now the here through which all future plunges to the past

I have everything I need to enjoy my here and nowunless I am letting my consciousness be dominated by demands and expectations based on the dead past or the imagined future

Today is the blocks with which we build

In order to be utterly happy the only thing necessary is to refrain from comparing this moment with other moments in the past which I often did not fully enjoy because I was comparing them with other moments of the future

Seize from every moment its unique novelty and do not prepare your joys

You dont need endless time and perfect conditions Do it now Do it today Do it for twenty minutes and watch your heart start beating

Do not manage as if you had ten thousand years before you Look you death stands at your elbow make the most of your minute and be good for something while it is in your power

And if not now when

As we are always preparing to be happy it is inevitable that we should never be so

Why not seize the pleasure at once How often is happiness destroyed by preparation foolish preparation

When shall we live if not now

We cannot put off living until we are ready The most salient characteristic of life is its coerciveness it is always urgent here and now without any possible postponement Life is fired at us pointblank

Very few men properly speaking live at present but are providing to live another time

Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present

Freedom from worries and surcease from strain are illusions that always inhabit the distance

Study as if you were to live forever Live as if you were to die tomorrow

The best preparation for a better life next year is a full complete harmonious joyous life this year

If you spend your whole life waiting for the storm youll never enjoy the sunshine

Some people are making such thorough preparation for rainy days that they arent enjoying todays sunshine

The greater part of our lives is spent in dreaming over the morrow and when it comes it too is consumed in the anticipation of a brighter morrow and so the cheat is prolonged even to the grave

It is cheap generosity which promises the future in compensation for the present

Who knows if the gods above will add tomorrows span to this days sum

Defer not till tomorrow to be wise tomorrows sun to thee may never rise

My head is buried in the sands of tomorrow while my tail feathers are singed by the hot sun of today

Today well lived will prepare me for both the pleasure and the pain of tomorrow

The future belongs to those who live intensely in the present

Every moment that I am centered in the future I suffer a temporary loss of this life

We know nothing of tomorrow our business is to be good and happy today

We are always beginning to live but are never living

Live wastes itself while we are preparing to live

I have always been waiting for something bettersometimes to see the best I had snatched from me

Men spend their lives in anticipation in determining to be vastly happy at some period when they have time But the present time has one advantage over every otherit is our own We may lay in a stock of pleasures as we would lay in a stock of wine but if we defer the tasting of them too long we shall find that both are soured by age

You do well to have visions of a better life than of every day but it is the life of every day from which the elements of a better life must come

The most effective way to ensure the value of the future is to confront the present courageously and constructively

The habit of looking into the future and thinking that the whole meaning of the present lies in what it will bring forth is a pernicious one There can be no value in the whole unless there is value in the parts

You dont save a pitcher for tomorrow Tomorrow it may rain

Very strange is this quality of our human nature which decrees that unless we feel a future before us we do not live completely in the present

Just do your best today and tomorrow will come tomorrows going to be a busy day a happy day

Do todays duty fight todays temptation do not weaken and distract yourself by looking forward to things you cannot see and could not understand if you saw them

The best preparation for good work tomorrow is to do good work today

Live for today Multitudes of people have failed to live for today What they have had within their grasp today they have missed entirely because only the future has intrigued them

Present opportunities are neglected and attainable good is slighted by minds busied in extensive ranges and intent upon future advantages

Light tomorrow with today

A preoccupation with the future not only prevents us from seeing the present as it is but often prompts us to rearrange the past

The man least dependent upon the morrow goes to meet the morrow most cheerfully

Todays egg is better than tomorrows hen

Twere too absurd to slight for the hereafter the days delight

The best part of our lives we pass in counting on what is to come

It seems to be the fate of man to seek all his consolations in futurity

The prospect of being pleased tomorrow will never console me for the boredom of today

To live only for some future goal is shallow Its the sides of the mountain that sustain life not the top

We steal if we touch tomorrow It is Gods

The past and present are only our means the future is always our end Thus we never really live but only hope to live

The president is the representative of the whole nation and hes the only lobbyist that all the one hundred and sixty million people in this country have

Trying to make the presidency work these days is like trying to sew buttons on a custard pie

Th prisidincy is th highest office in th gift iv th people Th viceprisidincy is th next highest an the lowest It isnt a crime exactly Ye cant be sint to jail f r it but its a kind iv a disgrace

Seriously I do not think I am fit for the presidency

An eminent American is reported to have said to friends who wished to put him forward Gentlemen let there be no mistake I should make a good president but a very bad candidate

Well I wouldnt say that I was in the great class but I had a great time while I was trying to be great

The presidency does not yield to definition Like the glory of a morning sunrise it can be experienced it can not be told

When the president does it that means it is not illegal

A presidents hardest task is not to do whats right but to know whats right

Had I been chosen president again I am certain I could not have lived another year

The four most miserable years of my life

If you are as happy my dear sir on entering this house as I am in leaving it and returning home you are the happiest man in the country

I feel like the man who was tarred and feathered and ridden out of town on a rail To the man who asked how he liked it he said If it wasnt for the honour of the thing Id rather walk

The office of president requires the constitution of an athlete the patience of a mother the endurance of an early Christian

Within the first few months I discovered that being a president is like riding a tiger A man has to keep riding or be swallowed

Harricum Harricum Give em hell Harricum

In America any boy may become president and I suppose its just one of the risks he takes

I have no expectation of making a hit every time I come to bat

I think the American public wants a solemn ass as a president and I think Ill go along with them

I desire to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if at the end I have lost every friend on earth I shall have one friend left and that friend shall be down inside me

The final greatness of the presidency lies in the truth that it is not just an office of incredible power but a breeding ground of indestructible myth

I beg leave to assure the Congress that no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept this arduous employment at the expense of my domestic ease and happiness I do not wish to make any profit from it

Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result

Dont let it be forgot That once there was a spot For one brief shining moment That was known as Camelot

The buck stops here

The ocean and I have many pebbles To find and wash off and roll into shape

The sea possesses a power over ones moods that has the effect of a will The sea can hypnotize Nature in general can do so

Roll on thou deep and dark blue ocean roll Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain Man marks the earth with ruin his control Stops with the shore

The sea the truth must be confessed has no generosity No display of manly qualities courage hardihood endurance faithfulness has ever been known to touch its irresponsible consciousness of power

Being in a ship is being in a jail with the chance of being drowned

The sea hath no king but God alone

Love the sea I dote upon it from the beach

I liked to sail alone The sea was the same as a girl to me I did not want anyone else along

I do not love the sea The look of it is disquieting There is something in the very sound of it that stirs the premonition felt while we listen to noble music we become inexplicably troubled

The only cure for seasickness is to sit on the shady side of an old church in the country

I have observed on board a steamer how men and women easily give way to their instinct for flirtation because water has the power of washing away our sense of responsibility and those who on land resemble the oak in their firmness behave like floating seaweed when on the sea

A poor woman from Manchester on being taken to the seaside is said to have expressed her delight on seeing for the first time something of which there was enough for everybody

Theres never an end for the sea

April is the cruellest month breeding Lilacs out of the dead land mixing memory and desire stirring dull roots with Spring rain

Autumn wins you best by this its mute Appeal to sympathy for its decay

Honest Winter snowclad and with the frosted beard I can welcome not uncordially But that long deferment of the calendars promise that weeping gloom of March and April that bitter blast outraging the honour of May how often has it robbed me of heart and hope

No one thinks of Winter when the grass is green

No Winter lasts forever no Spring skips its turn April is a promise that May is bound to keep and we know it

The nicest thing about the promise of spring is that sooner or later shell have to keep it

Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York

Every April God rewrites the Book of Genesis

The changing years progressive plan Proclaims mortality to man

Summer is the mother of the poor

Take a winter as you find him and he turns out to be a thoroughly honest fellow with no nonsense in him and tolerating none in you which is a great comfort in the long run

Summer ends and Autumn comes and he who would have it otherwise would have high tide always and a full moon every night

Junes too soon Julys too late for summer

April Comes like an idiot babbling and strewing flowers

Autumn arrives in the early morning but spring at the close of a winters day

Autumn is the bite of a harvest apple

May is a pious fraud of the almanac A ghastly parody of real Spring Shaped out of snow and breathed with eastern wind

The first day of spring was once the time for taking the young virgins into the fields there in dalliance to set an example in fertility for Nature to follow Now we just set the clock an hour ahead and change the oil in the crankcase

There is honor among thieves

Set a thief to catch a thief

A plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another

When thieves fall out honest men come by their own

Stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant

A library is thought in cold storage

A man is not idle because he is absorbed in thought There is a visible labour and there is an invisible labour

An Englishman thinks seated a Frenchman standing an American pacing an Irishman afterward

Analogies it is true decide nothing but they can make one feel more at home

Data data everywhere but not a thought to think

One must live the way one thinks or end up thinking the way one has lived

One thought fills immensity

Sometimes people mistake the way I talk for what I am thinking

Thought is the labour of the intellect reverie is its pleasure

Three minutes thought would suffice to find this out but thought is irksome and three minutes is a long time

When thought becomes excessively painful action is the finest remedy

Worrying is the most natural and spontaneous of all human functions It is time to acknowledge this perhaps even to learn to do it better

All thought is a feat of association having whats in front of you bring up something in your mind that you almost didnt know you knew

We only think when we are confronted with a problem

The extra calories needed for one hour of intense mental effort would be completely met by eating one oyster cracker or one half of a salted peanut

Every man who says frankly and fully what he thinks is doing a public service

Thought is the strongest thing we have Work done by true and profound thought that is a real force

When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight it concentrates his mind wonderfully

We find it hard to believe that other peoples thoughts are as silly as our own but they probably are

Thinking is like loving and dying each of us must do it for himself

A man of action forced into a state of thought is unhappy until he can get out of it

It is human nature to think wisely and to act in an absurd fashion

Men use thought only to justify their wrongdoings and speech only to conceal their thoughts

And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit

The real offence as she ultimately perceived was her having a mind of her own at all Her mind was to be his attached to his own like a small garden plot to a deer park

To be uncertain is to be uncomfortable but to be certain is to be ridiculous

Think wrongly if you please but in all cases think for yourself

The thoughts that come often unsought and as it were drop into the mind are commonly the most valuable of any we have

We shall succeed only so far as we continue that most distasteful of all activity the intolerable labour of thought

Profundity of thought belongs to youth clarity of thought to old age

Every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of somebody or other

What was once thought can never be unthought

Many a time I have wanted to stop talking and find out what I really believed

Man is a slow sloppy and brilliant thinker the machine is fast accurate and stupid

Folks that blurt out just what they think wouldnt be so bad if they thought

Facts in books statistics in encyclopedias the ability to use them in mens heads

Knowledge is a process of piling up facts wisdom lies in their simplification

The fundamental fact about the Greek was that he had to use his mind The ancient priests had said Thus far and no farther We set the limits of thought The Greek said All things are to be examined and called into question There are no limits set on thought

Thought is born of failure

Speaking without thinking is shooting without taking aim

What you think is an illusion created by your glands your emotions and in the last analysis by the content of your stomach That gray matter youre so proud of is like a mirror in an amusement park which transmits to you nothing but distorted signals from reality forever beyond your grasp

Many highly intelligent people are poor thinkers Many people of average intelligence are skilled thinkers The power of a car is separate from the way the car is driven

Belief is harder to shake than knowledge

The bliss een of a moment still is bliss

Every second is of infinite value

The bliss een of a moment still is bliss

Let me tell thee time is a very precious gift of God so precious that its only given to us moment by moment

There are half hours that dilate to the importance of centuries

Thisthis was what made life a moment of quiet the water falling in the fountain the girls voice a moment of captured beauty He who is truly wise will never permit such moments to escape

We do not remember days we remember moments

Life is a succession of moments To live each one is to succeed

The span of life is waning fast Beware unthinking youth beware Thy souls eternity depends Upon the record moments bear

Florence Farr once said to me If we could say to ourselves with sincerity this passing moment is as good as any I shall ever know we could die upon the instant and be united with God

Sometimes I would almost rather have people take away years of my life than take away a moment

Life is not lost by dying life is lost minute by minute day by day in all the thousand small uncaring ways

I have the happiness of the passing moment and what more can mortal ask

The sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment

I always say to myself what is the most important thing we can think about at this extraordinary moment

Fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run

The present moment is creative creating with an unheardof intensity

The only way to live is to accept each minute as an unrepeatable miracle which is exactly what it is a miracle and unrepeatable

Who makes quick use of the moment is a genius of prudence

I live now and only now and I will do what I want to do this moment and not what I decided was best for me yesterday

But what minutes Count them by sensation and not by calendars and each moment is a day

It may be life is only worthwhile at moments Perhaps that is all we ought to expect

To finish the moment to find the journeys end in every step of the road to live the greatest number of good hours is wisdom

Our latest moment is always our supreme moment Five minutes delay in dinner now is more important than a great sorrow ten years gone

God speaks to all individuals through what happens to them moment by moment

Be always resolute with the present hour Every moment is of infinite value

A players effectiveness is directly related to his ability to be right there doing that thing in the moment He cant be worrying about the past or the future or the crowd or some other extraneous event He must be able to respond in the here and now

We inhabit ourselves without valuing ourselves unable to see that here now this very moment is sacred but once its goneits value is incontestable

Life is all memory except for the one present moment that goes by so quick you can hardly catch it going

The trouble is not that we are never happyit is that happiness is so episodical

Noncooks think its silly to invest two hours work in two minutes enjoyment but if cooking is evanescent so is the ballet

We have only this moment sparkling like a star in our hand and melting like a snowflake Let us use it before it is too late

It is privilege of living to be acutely agonizingly conscious of the moment that is always present and always passing

The passing moment is all we can be sure of it is only common sense to extract its utmost value from it

He is blessed over all mortals who loses no moment of the passing life

We must not wish anything other than what happens from moment to moment all the while however exercising ourselves in goodness

The only courage that matters is the kind that gets you from one moment to the next

The moment of change is the only poem

If it werent for the last minute nothing would get done

Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide And the choice goes by forever twixt that darkness and that light

I have always felt that the moment when first you wake up in the morning is the most wonderful of the twentyfour hours No matter how weary or dreary you may feel you possess the certainty that absolutely anything may happen And the fact that it practically always doesnt matters not one jot The possibility is always there

Every age can be enchanting provided you live within it

To live exhilaratingly in and for the moment is deadly serious work fun of the most exhausting sort

Love the moment and the energy of the moment will spread beyond all boundaries

Life isnt a matter of milestones but of moments

The power of Thought the magic of the Mind

My thoughts ran a woolgathering

Any man may make a mistake none but a fool will stick to it Second thoughts are best as the proverb says

Learning without thought is labor lost

I think therefore I am

Thoughts that breathe and words that burn

Great thoughts reduced to practice become great acts

The mind grows by what it feeds on

A penny for your thought

Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature

As he thinketh in his heart so is he

There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so

Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look He thinks too much such men are dangerous

They are never alone that are accompanied with noble thoughts

Great thoughts come from the heart

Its no use filling your pocket with money if you have got a hole in the corner

A penny saved is a penny earned

It is better to have a hen tomorrow than an egg today

He that will not stoop for a pin will never be worth a pound

A man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man because he has both enjoyments

That great artillery of God Almighty

3 oclock is always too late or too early for anything you want to do

All movements go too far

Nothing is improbable until it moves into the past tense

Nothing really belongs to us but time which even he has who has nothing else

Respect the past in the full measure of its desserts but do not make the mistake of confusing it with the present nor seek in it the ideals of the future

The butterfly counts not months but moments And has time enough

The passing minute is every mans equal possession but what has once gone by is not ours

This only is denied even to God the power to undo the past

Time is a Test of Trouble But not a Remedy If such it proved it proves too There was no Melody

Time is the rider that breaks youth

To excel the past we must not allow ourselves to lose contact with it on the contrary we must feel it under our feet because we raised ourselves upon it

Time is a great legalizer even in the fields of morals

Time goes you say Ah no Alas Time stays we go

Let time that makes you homely make you sage

I dont ask for your pity but just your understanding no not even that no Just for your recognition of me in you and the enemy time in us all

All things flow nothing abides

When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think its only a minute But when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think its two hours Thats relativity

There was a young lady named Bright Who could travel much faster than light She started one day In the relative way And came back on the previous night

Longevity conquers scandal every time

What may be done at any time will be done at no time

One of these days is none of these days

Punctuality is the thief of time

Enjoy the present hour Be thankful for the past And neither fear nor wish Th approaches of the last

Horus non numero nisi serenas I count only the sunny hours

The only true time which a man can properly call his own is that which he has all to himself the rest though in some sense he may be said to live it is other peoples time not his

I want to go ahead of Father Time with a scythe of my own

Time is a great teacher but unfortunately it kills all its pupils

One third of the people of the world are asleep at any given moment The other two thirds are awake and probably stirring up trouble somewhere

Time and I against any two

Time discovered truth

Time gives good advice

What a day may bring a day may take away

Time is a kindly god

Time goes by reputation increases ability declines

Time cools time clarifies no mood can be maintained quite unaltered through the course of hours

Every minute starts an hour

Time wounds all heels

The apparent serenity of the past is an oil spread by time

Time is a sort of river of passing events and strong is its current no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place and this too will be swept away

It takes time to save time

The mind of man works with strangeness upon the body of time An hour once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length on the other hand an hour may be accurately represented by the timepiece of the mind by one second

When you have a great and difficult task something perhaps almost impossible if you only work a little at a time every day a little suddenly the work will finish itself

Champions know there are no shortcuts to the top They climb the mountain one step at a time They have no use for helicopters

The world doesnt come to the clever folks it comes to the stubborn obstinate oneideaatatime people

One big vice in a man is apt to keep out a great many smaller ones

Vice is as much a part of human nature as folly and pornography may be as necessary to vent vice as satire is to vent folly

He who hates vice hates men

Nurse one vice in your bosom Give it the attention it deserves and let your virtues spring up modestly around it Then youll have the miser whos no liar and the drunkard whos the benefactor of a whole city

The vices we scoff at in others laugh at us within ourselves

It is the function of vice to keep virtue within reasonable grounds

When our vices leave us we flatter ourselves with the credit of having left them

Many without punishment none without sin

If individuals have no virtues their vices may be of use to us

If you dont want anyone to know it dont do it

Ill habits gather by unseen degrees As brooks make rivers rivers run to seas

Vice can be learnt even without a teacher

Theres a small choice in rotten apples

Everyone has his faults which he continually repeats neither fear nor shame can cure them

The ability to sin differs among people For example a shortarmed fisherman isnt as big a liar as a longarmed one

I have a simple philosophy Fill whats empty Empty whats full And scratch where it itches

You cant act like a skunk without someones getting wind of it

I dont gamble I invest with a risk

At home I am a nice guy but I dont want the world to know Humble people Ive found dont go very far

I never gossip but I can give you the names of certain people who do

Laziness is nothing more than the habit of resting before you get tired

He talks at the drop of a pause

Deep down Im really shallow

No one can have a higher opinion of him than I have and I think hes a dirty little beast

Everybody hates me because Im so universally liked

I have too much respect for the truth to drag it out on every trifling occasion

Laugh and the world laughs with you snore and you sleep alone

How beautiful is victory but how dear

Victories that are cheap are cheap Those only are worth having which come as the result of hard fighting

To the victors belong the spoils

Who overcomes By force hath overcome but half his foe

There are some defeats more triumphant than victories

We have met the enemy and they are ours

It is better to be violent if there is violence in our hearts than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence

Keep violence in the mind Where it belongs

Violence is the quest for identity When identity disappears with technological innovation violence is the natural recourse

Violence is essentially wordless and it can begin only where thought and rational communication have broken down

You know what I think about violence For me it is profoundly moral more moral than compromises and transactions

Violence is just where kindness is vain

It is unfair to blame man too fiercely for being pugnacious he learned the habit from Nature

Is some cases nonviolence requires more militancy than violence

We are all shot through with enough motives to make a massacre any day of the week that we want to give them their head

In a war of ideas it is people who get killed

The private terror of the liberal spirit is invariably suicide not murder

Violence is essentially a confession of ultimate inarticulateness

Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon It is a weapon unique in history which cuts without wounding and enobles the man who wields it It is a sword that heals

Today violence is the rhetoric of the period

A tragic situation exists precisely when virtue does not triumph but when it is still felt that man is nobler than the forces which destroy him

Humility is a virtue and it is a virtue innate in guests

The sun though it passes through dirty places yet remains as pure as before

There are few virtues which the Poles do not possess and there are few errors they have ever avoided

Virtue has its own reward but no sale at the box office

When virtue has slept she will get up more refreshed

Few men have virtue to withstand the highest bidder

Purity is obscurity

I know myself too well to believe in pure virtue

There are few chaste women who are not tired of their trade

Ascetic one who makes a necessity of virtue

A virtue to be serviceable must like gold be alloyed with some commoner but more durable metal

The Saints are the Sinners who keep on trying

No doubt alcohol tobacco and so forth are things that a saint must avoid but sainthood is also a thing that human beings must avoid

If a man has no vices hes in great danger of making vices about his virtues and theres a spectacle

When men grow virtuous in their old age they only make a sacrifice to God of the devils leavings

Ones outlook is a part of his virtue

Virtue is like a rich stone best plain set

Recommend to your children virtue that alone can make them happy not gold

I believe that Virtue shows quite as well in rags and patches as she does in purple and fine linen

There are those who have nothing chaste but their ears and nothing virtuous but their tongues

The only reward of virtue is virtue

Most men admire Virtue who follow not her lore

Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised

Virtue is an angel but she is a blind one and must ask of Knowledge to show her the pathway that leads to her goal

I prefer an accommodation vice to an obstinate virtue

Virtue is health vice is sickness

Virtue consists not in abstaining from vice but in not desiring it

Virtue often trips and falls on the sharpedged rock of poverty

Abou Ben Adhem may his tribe increase Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace And saw within the moonlight in his room Making it rich and like a lily in bloom An angel writing in a book of gold Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold And to the presence in the room he said What writest thou The Vision raised its head And with a look made all of sweet accord Answered The names of those who love the Lord

Where there is no vision the people perish

And it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions

My thoughts by night are often filled With visions false as fair For in the past alone I build My castles in the air

Before you begin a thing remind yourself that difficulties and delays quite impossible to foresee are ahead You can only see one thing clearly and that is your goal Form a mental vision of that and cling to it through thick and thin

Man can only receive what he sees himself receiving

A person can grow only as much as his horizon allows

All prosperity begins in the mind and is dependent only upon the full use of our creative imagination

If we have not achieved our early dreams we must either find new ones or see what we can salvage from the old If we have accomplished what we set out to do in our youth we need not weep like Alexander the Great that we have no more worlds to conquer

What man can imagine he may one day achieve

Envisioning the end is enough to put the means in motion

Our visions begin with our desires

It is in our idleness in our dreams that the submerged truth sometimes comes to the top

One must desire something to be alive perhaps absolute satisfaction is only another name for Death

The truth isnt always beauty but the hunger for it is

When your dreams tire they go underground and out of kindness thats where they stay

Nothing happens unless first a dream

The very least you can do in your life is to figure out what you hope for And the most you can do is live inside that hope Not admire it from a distance but live right in it under its roof

The history of all times and of today especially teaches that women will be forgotten if they forget to think about themselves

Instead of thinking about where you are think about where you want to be It takes twenty years of hard work to become an overnight success

To the lack of incentive to effort which is the awful shadow under which we live may be traced the wreck and ruin of scores of colored youth

The moment of enlightenment is when a persons dreams of possibilities become images of probabilities

Reach high for stars lie hidden in your soul Dream deep for every dream precedes the goal

When we cant dream any longer we die

Hold fast to dreams for if dreams die life is a brokenwinged bird that cannot fly

I think at a childs birth if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift that gift should be curiosity

You know my children that humanity advances only by forming itself an ideal and endeavoring to realize it Every passion has its ideal which is modified by that of the whole

It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are alive There are certain things we feel to be beautiful and good and we must hunger for them

The best antidote I have found is to yearn for something As long as you yearn you cant congeal there is a forward motion to yearning

Every woman dreams of her own political career and her own place in life

Dream lofty dreams and as you dream so shall you become Your vision is the promise of what you shall at last unveil

Imagination is the highest kite that can fly

Who would ever give up the reality of dreams for relative knowledge

Dreams are the sources of action the meeting and the end a resting place among the flight of things

Within your heart keep one still secret spot where dreams may go

Ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind

It may be that those who do most dream most

Ive dreamt in my life dreams that have stayed with me ever after and changed my ideas theyve gone through and through me like wine through water and altered the color of my mind

Its our dreams that keep us going that separate us from the beasts I wouldnt even want to live if I thought it was all just eating and sleeping and taking off my clothes

A couple of times a day I sit quietly and visualize my body fighting the AIDS virus Its the same as me sitting and seeing myself hit the perfect serve I did that often when I was an athlete

Is life so wretched Isnt it rather your hands which are too small your vision which is muddled You are the one who must grow up

Imagination has always had powers of resurrection that no science can match

The artist doesnt see things as they are but as he is

Makebelieve colors the past with innocent distortion and it swirls ahead of us in a thousand waysin science in politics in every bold intention It is part of our collective lives entwining our past and our future a particularly rewarding aspect of life itself

We are governed not by armies but by ideas

One of your most powerful inner resources is your own creativity Be willing to try on something new and play the game fullout

No vision and you perish No ideal and youre lost Your heart must ever cherish Some faith at any cost Some hope some dream to cling to Some rainbow in the sky Some melody to sing to Some service that is high

Five minutes just before going to sleep given to a bit of directed imagination regarding achievement possibilities of the morrow will steadily and increasingly bear fruit particularly if all ideas of difficulty worry or fear are resolutely ruled out and replaced by those of accomplishment and smiling courage

With our progress we have destroyed our only weapon against tedium that rare weakness we call imagination

You can vitally influence your life from within by autosuggestion The first thing each morning and the last thing each night suggest to yourself specific ideas that you wish to embody in your character and personality Address such suggestions to yourself silently or aloud until they are deeply impressed upon your mind

Leaders are visionaries with a poorly developed sense of fear and no concept of the odds against them They make the impossible happen

When there is no vision people perish

The voice of the people is the voice of God

The voice of one crying in the wilderness

Her voice was ever soft Gentle and low an excellent thing in woman

A fair days wages for a fair days work it is as just a demand as governed men ever made of government

It is but a truism that labor is most productive where its wages are largest Poorly paid labor is inefficient labor the world over

The laborer is worthy of his hire

Be content with your wages

The iron law of wages

Man wants but little here below Nor wants that little long

Constantly choose rather to want less than to have more

The stoical scheme of supplying our wants by lopping off our desires is like cutting off our feet when we want shoes

How few our real wants and how vast our imaginary ones

A conventional army loses if it does not win The guerrilla wins if it does not lose

Above all Vietnam was a war that asked everything of a few and nothing of most in America

All wars are popular for the first 30 days

Do not let us speak of darker days let us speak rather of sterner days These are not dark days these are great days the greatest days our country has ever lived

Good things when short are twice as good

I have never understood disliking for war It panders to instincts already catered for within the scope of any respectable domestic establishment

If a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand

In time of war the devil makes more room in hell

In war the will is directed at an animate object that reacts

Let us not be deceived we are today in the midst of a cold war

Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties and so bear ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for a thousand years men will still say This was their finest hour

Morality is contraband in war

Scots wha hae wi Wallace bled Scots wham Bruce has aften led Welcome to your gory bed Or to victorie

So long as the antimilitarists propose no substitute for wars disciplinary function no moral equivalent of war analogous as one might say to the mechanical equivalent of hate so long they fail to realize the full equities of the situation

Television brought the brutality of war into the comfort of the living room Vietnam was lost in the living rooms of USA not on the battlefields of Vietnam

The quickest way of ending a war is to lose it

There never was a good war or a bad peace

They will conquer but they will not convince

We few we happy few we band of brothers For he today that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother

Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee Agreed to have a battle For Tweedle Dum said Tweedle Dee Had spoiled his nice new rattle

We shall not flag or fail We shall fight in France we shall fight on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on the beaches we shall fight on the landing grounds we shall fight in the fields and in the streets we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender

When the rich wage war its the poor who die

We only win at war because we fight another government If we fought private industry we would not last until noontime

War is much too important a matter to be left to the generals

War is mainly a catalogue of blunders

War is a series of catastrophes which result in victory

It would indeed be a tragedy if the history of the human race proved to be nothing more than the story of an ape playing with a box of matches on a petrol dump

Either war is obsolete or men are

War appeals to young men because it is fundamentally autoeroticism

Wars are not fought for territory but for words Mans deadliest weapon is language He is as susceptible to being hypnotized by slogans as he is to infectious diseases And where there is an epidemic the groupmind takes over

A war regarded as inevitable or even probable and therefore much prepared for has a very good chance of eventually being fought

War is the unfolding of miscalculations

If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles

Today the real test of power is not capacity to make war but capacity to prevent it

As long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination When it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular

What the hell difference does it make left or right There were good men lost on both sides

The supreme excellence is not to win a hundred victories in a hundred battles The supreme excellence is to subdue the armies of your enemies without even having to fight them

Frankly Id like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole field to private industry

War is the national industry of Prussia

It is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars civilization itself seeming to be in the balance But the right is more precious than peace and we shall fight for the things which we have always carried nearest our hearts for democracy

Sweet is war to those who have never experienced it

The possibility of war increases in direct proportion to the effectiveness of the instruments of war

I dont know what effect these men will have on the enemy but by God they frighten me

Boys are the cash of war Whoever said were not free spenders doesnt know our like

In time of war the first casualty is truth

World War II was the last government program that really worked

Its one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle to get ones head cut off

No one can guarantee success in war but only deserve it

There is no such thing as inevitable war If war comes it will be from failure of human wisdom

The world will never have lasting peace so long as men reserve for war the finest human qualities

War would end if the dead could return

If they want peace nations should avoid the pinpricks that precede cannon shots

Sometime theyll give a war and nobody will come

A man who experiences no genuine satisfaction in life does not want peace People court war to escape meaninglessness and boredom to be relieved of fear and frustration

The object of war is to survive it

So far war has been the only force that can discipline a whole community and until an equivalent discipline is organized I believe that war must have its way

Men love war because it allows them to look serious because it is the only thing that stops women laughing at them

War hath no fury like a noncombatant

Most sorts of diversion in men children and other animals are in imitation of fighting

Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won

Human war has been the most successful of all our cultural traditions

War is the trade of kings

The whole art of war consists of guessing at what is on the other side of the hill

It is well that war is so terrible we would grow too fond of it

Men grow tired of sleep love singing and dancing sooner than of war

Most people coming out of war feel lost and resentful What had been a minutetominute confrontation with yourself your struggle with what courage you have against discomfort at the least and death at the other end ties you to the people you have known in the war and makes for a time others seem alien and frivolous

Vice stirs up war virtue fights

In peace sons bury their fathers in war fathers bury their sons

War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today

The weak against the strong Is always in the wrong

But in case signals can neither be seen or perfectly understood no captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside the enemy

Something must be left to chance nothing is sure in a sea fight beyond all others

War is like love it always finds a way

The guerilla must live amongst the people as the fish lives in the water

It simply is not true that war never settles anything

War does not determine who is right only who is left

There are no atheists in the foxholes

There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory but boys it is all hell

There will be no veterans of World War III

War is the science of destruction

The inevitableness the idealism and the blessing of war as an indispensable and stimulating law of development must be repeatedly emphasized

Great Britain was going to make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to be friends with her

Better pointed bullets than pointed speeches

War never leaves where it found a nation

Veni vidi vici I came I saw I conquered

The great questions of the day are not decided by speeches and majority votes but by blood and iron

What millions died that Caesar might be great

What distinguishes war is not that man is slain but that he is slain spoiled crushed by the cruelty the injustice the treachery the murderous hand of man

General Taylor never surrenders

We give up the fort when theres not a man left to defend it

War he sung is toil and trouble Honour but an empty bubble

By the rude bridge that arched the flood Their flag to Aprils breeze unfurld Here once the embattld farmers stood And fired the shot heard round the world

There never was a good war or a bad peace

Hang yourself brave Crillon We fought at Arques and you were not there

It is not right to exult over slain men

War is as much a punishment to the punisher as to the sufferer

Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword His truth is marching on

We dont want to fight but by jingo if we do Weve got the ships weve got the men weve got the money too Weve fought the Bear before and while were Britons true The Russians shall not have Constantinople

I have prayed in her fields of poppies I have laughed with the men who died But in all my ways and through all my days Like a friend He walked beside I have seen a sight under Heaven That only God understands In the battles glare I have seen Christ there With the Sword of God in His hand

Modern warfare is an intricate business about which no one knows everything and few know very much

There is no such thing as an inevitable war If war comes it will be from failure of human wisdom

0 God assist our side at least avoid assisting the enemy and leave the rest to me

The ballot is stronger than the bullet

To arms to arms ye brave The avenging sword unsheathe March on march on all hearts resolved On victory or death

Ez for war I call it murder There you hev it plain and flat I dont want to go no furder Than my Testyment for that

War is the greatest plague that can afflict humanity it destroys religion it destroys states it destroys families Any scourge is preferable to it

Take up our quarrel with the foe To you from failing hands we throw The torch be yours to hold it high If ye break faith with us who die We shall not sleep though poppies grow In Flanders fields

War hath no fury like a noncombatant

Wars and rumours of wars

And this I hate not men nor flag nor race But only War with its wild grinning face

When after many battles past Both tird with blows make peace at last What is it after all the people get Why taxes widows wooden legs and debt

The brazen throat of war

God how the dead men Grin by the wall Watching the fun Of the Victory Ball

O war thou son of Hell

A bad peace is even worse than war

As long as war is regarded as wicked it will always have its fascination When it is looked upon as vulgar it will cease to be popular

The father of his country

He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent

I glory more in the coming purchase of my wealth than in the glad possession

Ill fares the land to hastening ills of prey Where wealth accumulates and men decay

It is the wretchedness of being rich that you have to live with rich people

One cannot both feast and become rich

Poor men seek meat for their stomach rich men stomach for their meat

Riches serve a wise man but command a fool

The first wealth is health

The smell of profit is clean and sweet whatever the source

There are few sorrows however poignant in which a good income is of no avail

The human race has had long experience and a fine tradition in surviving adversity But we now face a task for which we have little experience the task of surviving prosperity

Riches enlarge rather than satisfy appetites

Australia is so kind that just tickle her with a hoe and she laughs with a harvest

It is better to live rich than to die rich

We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cant have both

I am opposed to millionaires but it would be dangerous to offer me the position

Sleep riches and health to be truly enjoyed must be interrupted

The wealth of a nation consists not in its mass of material things but in its system The natural resources of South America are not inferior to those of the United States but the wealth of the two regions is vastly different The land of India is far richer than that of Japan but the comparative wealth of the two nations is reversed

I have enough money to get by Im not independently wealthy just independently lazy I suppose

I have no complex about wealth I have worked hard for my money producing things people need I believe that the able industrial leader who creates wealth and employment is more worthy of historical notice than politicians or soldiers

I was born into it and there was nothing I could do about it It was there like air or food or any other element The only question with wealth is what you do with it

Riches do not consist in the possession of treasures but in the use made of them

I wish to become rich so that I can instruct the people and glorify honest poverty a little like those kindhearted fat benevolent people do

In big houses in which things are done properly there is always the religious element The diurnal cycle is observed with more feeling when there are servants to do the work

True abundance is not about gathering more things its about touching the place in us that is connected to the divine source of abundance so that we know what we need in the moment will be provided

Its time we put thoughts of lack behind us Its time for us to discover the secrets of the stars to sail to an uncharted land to open up a new heaven where our spirits can soar

It is good to have things that money can buy but it is also good to check up once in awhile and be sure we have the things money cant buy

Ordinary riches can be stolen real riches cannot In your soul are infinitely precious things that cannot be taken from you

Let us not get so busy or live so fast that we cant listen to the music of the meadow or the symphony that glorifies the forest Some things in the world are far more important than wealth one of them is the ability to enjoy simple things

It is wealth to be content

Who is rich He that rejoices in his portion

If youre happy youre wealthy Happiness doesnt need a bank account

Wealth is a relative thing since he that has little and wants less is richer than he that has much but wants more

Sometimes when you have everything you cant really tell what matters

The only question with wealth is what you do with it

The rich man is not one who is in possession of much but one who gives much

Having given all he had He then is very rich indeed

If you see yourself as prosperous you will be If you see yourself as continually hard up that is exactly what you will be

Prosperity is just around the corner

Wealth is not his that has it but his who enjoys it

I have mental joys and mental health Mental friends and mental wealth Ive a wife that I love and that loves me Ive all but riches bodily

Surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer in his lifetime for the good of the community

If you would be wealthy think of saving as well as of getting

The ideal social state is not that in which each gets an equal amount of wealth but in which each gets in proportion to his contribution to the general stock

Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey Where wealth accumulates and men decay Princes and Lords may flourish or may fade A breath can make them as a breath has made But a bold peasantry their countrys pride When once destroyd can never be supplied

Riches either serve or govern the possessor

The wealth of nations is men not silk and cotton and gold

Life is short The sooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better

Our Lord commonly giveth Riches to such gross asses to whom he affordeth nothing else that is good

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God

I am rich beyond the dreams of avarice

All wealth is the product of labor

Get place and wealth if possible with grace If not by any means get wealth and place

Riches certainly make themselves wings

He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent

He heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them

No good man ever became suddenly rich

Can snore upon the flint when resty sloth Finds the down pillow hard

One of the most adventurous things left is to go to bed for no one can lay a hand on our dreams

Sleeping is no mean art For its sake one must stay awake all day

Sleep faster we need the pillows

That we are not much sicker and much madder than we are is due exclusively to that most blessed and blessing of all natural graces sleep

I never sleep in comfort save when I am hearing a sermon or praying to God

Sleep kinsman thou to death and trance and madness

Thou hast been called O sleep the friend of woe But tis the happy who have called thee so

Yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep

Sleep takes off the costume of circumstance arms us with terrible freedom so that every will rushes to deed A skillful man reads his dreams for his selfknowledge yet not the details but the quality What part does he play in them a cheerful manly part or a poor drivelling part However monstrous and grotesque their apparitions they have a substantial truth

For some must watch while some must sleep thus runs the world away

As a rule man is a fool When its hot he wants it cool When its cool he wants it hot Always wanting what is not

Change of weather is the discourse of fools

I was born with a chronic anxiety about the weather

Fair weather cometh out of the north

Oh what a blamed uncertain thing This pesky weather is It blew and snew and then it thew And now by jing its friz

When two Englishmen meet their first talk is of the weather

Tis sweet to hear the watchdogs honest bark Bay deepmouthd welcome as we draw near home

Come in the evening come in the morning Come when expected come without warning Thousands of welcomes youll find here before you And the oftener you come the more well adore you

Welcome as the flowers in May

Westward the course of empire takes its way

Out where the handclasps a little stronger Out where the smile dwells a little longer Thats where the West begins

Go West young man and grow up with the country

Westward Ho

The weakest and most timorous are the most revengeful and implacable

When a mans willing and eager God joins in

April is the crudest month breeding Lilacs out of the dead land mixing Memory and desire stirring Dull roots with spring rain

Man is worse than an animal when he is an animal

Men are always wicked at bottom unless they are made good by some compulsion

God bears with the wicked but not forever

Weak men are apt to be cruel because they stick at nothing that may repair the ill effect of their mistakes

All cruelty springs from weakness

I must be cruel Only to be kind

We are oftener treacherous through weakness than through calculation

When we do evil We and our victims Are equally bewildered

Half of the harm that is done in this world Is due to people who want to feel important They dont mean to do harm but the harm does not interest them

We all have flaws and mine is being wicked

Why inflict pain on oneself when so many others are ready to save us the trouble

God bears with the wicked but not forever

No man ever became very wicked all at once

The world loves a spice of wickedness

Wickedness is weakness

The wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion

The sun also shines on the wicked

Cause Is wicked I is Is mighty wicked anyhow I cant help it

Wives are young mens mistresses companions for middle age and old mens nurses

She is a winsome wee thing She is a handsome wee thing She is a bonny wee thing This sweet wee wife o mine

Think you if Laura had been Petrarchs wife He would have written sonnets all his life

In every mess I find a friend In every port a wife

An undutiful Daughter will prove an unmanageable Wife

He knows little who will tell his wife all he knows

A miss for pleasure and a wife for breed

Alas another instance of the triumph of hope over experience

All other goods by fortunes hand are given A wife is the peculiar gift of Heavn

She looketh well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness

It is a womans business to get married as soon as possible and a mans to keep unmarried as long as he can

My dear my better half

Men never cling to their dreams with such tenacity as at the moment when they are losing faith in them and know it but do not dare confess it to themselves

Nothing and no one can destroy the Chinese people They are relentless survivors

Nothing is easy to the unwilling

The greatest intellectual capacities are only found in connection with a vehement and passionate will

The spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak

The difference between perseverance and obstinacy is that one often comes from a strong will and the other from a strong wont

This freewill business is a bit terrifying anyway Its almost pleasanter to obey and make the most of it

Fall seven times stand up eight

Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great

The will is the strong blind man who carries on his shoulders the lame man who can see

Obstinacy is the result of the will forcing itself into the place of the intellect

Make voyages Attempt them Theres nothing else

Do what you can with what you have where you are
